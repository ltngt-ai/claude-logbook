# Agent Logging Implementation

## Date: 2025-06-08

### Overview
Implemented agent-specific logging system to help debug multi-agent interactions, particularly for the continuation protocol issue.

### Problem
- Agent logs weren't being created when agents executed tasks
- This made it difficult to debug why Phase 3 of continuation protocol wasn't executing
- The original implementation tried to use StructuredLogger which has a different API

### Solution

#### 1. Fixed AgentLogger Implementation
- Rewrote to use standard Python logging.Logger instead of StructuredLogger
- Each agent gets its own log file with pattern: `agent_{agent_id}_{clean_name}_{timestamp}.log`
- Log files are created in `logs/agents/` directory

#### 2. Integration with AsyncAgentManager
- Added `agent_type` field to AgentSession dataclass
- Integrated agent logging at key points:
  - Processor start
  - Task completion
  - Continuation detection
  - AI responses

#### 3. Unit Tests
Created comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Logger initialization
- File creation with correct naming
- Different message types (user, AI, tool calls)
- Multiple agents with separate logs
- Agent switching between logs
- Special character handling in agent IDs

### Key Findings

1. **Filename Format**:
   - With agent name: `agent_{agent_id}_{clean_name}_{timestamp}.log`
   - Without name: `agent_{agent_id}_{timestamp}.log`
   - Agent IDs are preserved as-is (not cleaned)
   - Agent names are cleaned (lowercase, special chars to underscores)

2. **Test Results**:
   - Individual tests pass correctly
   - Some tests fail when run in batch (possible timing/state issues)
   - Logger creates files successfully in isolation

### Usage Example

```python
from mindswarm.core.agent_logger import get_agent_logger

# Get global logger instance
agent_logger = get_agent_logger()

# Log an action
agent_logger.log_agent_action("test-agent", "Processing task", {
    "task_id": "task-123",
    "phase": "analysis"
})

# Log AI response
agent_logger.log_agent_message("test-agent", "ai_response", 
    "I'll analyze the data now...", 
    {"tokens": 150})
```

### Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**: Run the continuation protocol test with logging enabled to see agent decision-making
2. **Fix Test Stability**: Investigate why some tests fail in batch runs
3. **Enhance Logging**: Add more context about task phases and continuation decisions
