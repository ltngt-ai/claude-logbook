# MindSwarm Milestone Planning Session - June 9, 2025

## Major Milestones Identified

The user outlined four major milestone goals for MindSwarm:

1. **MindSwarm Assistant** - Natural language UI helper for project/workspace creation
2. **Task Execution Engine** - Agent-driven with sleep/wake cycles and manager communication
3. **Project Import System** - Import existing git folders and GitHub projects
4. **Workflow Templates** - Common development patterns automation

## Development Plan Created

### Phased Approach (3-month timeline)
- **Phase 0: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)** - Backend API Enhancement *(Critical Prerequisite)*
- **Phase 1: Project Management (Weeks 3-4)** - Import/Creation System
- **Phase 2: Task Execution (Weeks 5-7)** - Agent-Driven Engine
- **Phase 3: Assistant (Weeks 8-9)** - Natural Language UI Helper
- **Phase 4: Templates (Weeks 10-11)** - Workflow Automation
- **Week 12:** Integration and Polish

### Key Design Decisions

#### Phase Ordering Rationale
1. **Backend APIs First** - Already identified as critical blocker
2. **Project Import Second** - Foundational for all work
3. **Execution Engine Third** - Required for real task completion
4. **Assistant Fourth** - Enhances UX once core is solid
5. **Templates Last** - Builds on all previous components

#### Architecture Highlights

**Task Execution Engine State Machine:**
```
DORMANT → WAKING → ACTIVE → WORKING → BLOCKED/SLEEPING → DORMANT
                                 ↓
                             COMPLETED
```

**Assistant Capabilities:**
- Project operations via natural language
- Workspace management commands
- Task creation from descriptions
- Agent coordination requests

**Workflow Template Structure:**
- Parameterized definitions
- Step orchestration with dependencies
- Agent requirements specification
- Success validation rules

## Immediate Actions (Phase 0)

### Week 1: Analysis & Design
- API gap analysis against BACKEND_API_ENHANCEMENT_SPEC.md
- Design workspace management APIs
- Design task orchestration APIs
- Plan legacy terminology cleanup

### Week 2: Implementation
- Implement workspace service and APIs
- Complete whisper→mindswarm migration
- Add WebSocket handlers
- Create comprehensive tests

## Updated Todo List
Added 4 new high-priority items:
- Project Import/Creation System
- Task Execution Engine
- MindSwarm Assistant Agent
- Workflow Templates

Marked "Backend API Gap Analysis" as in_progress to begin Phase 0.

## Documents Created
1. `/home/deano/projects/mindswarm-research/MILESTONE_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md` - Comprehensive 3-month plan
2. `/home/deano/projects/mindswarm-research/PHASE0_BACKEND_API_ACTION_PLAN.md` - Detailed 2-week sprint plan

## Success Metrics Defined
- Import success for 10+ project types
- Task completion rate > 95%
- Natural language accuracy > 85%
- Template success rate > 90%

This planning session establishes a clear path from current state to a fully functional multi-agent development platform with natural language control and automated workflows.
