# 2025-06-18: Fixed All xfailed Tests for ToolContext Pattern

## Summary
Fixed all 66 xfailed tests that were marked as "TODO: Fix test for new architecture" to work with the new ToolContext pattern. This was issue #167.

## Changes Made

### Test Files Updated
1. **test_analyze_languages.py** - Fixed 10 tests
2. **test_execute_command.py** - Fixed 7 tests
3. **test_get_file_content.py** - Fixed 2 tests
4. **test_list_directory.py** - Fixed 11 tests
5. **test_read_file.py** - Fixed 11 tests
6. **test_search_files.py** - Fixed 12 tests
7. **test_write_file.py** - Fixed 13 tests
8. **test_git_integration.py** - Fixed 2 tests + related updates

### Pattern Applied
For each test:
- Updated to use async/await pattern
- Added ToolContext import and setup using `set_context()`
- Changed `execute()` to `execute_async()`
- Updated error assertions to match tool implementations
- Removed all xfail markers
- Fixed mocking to use filesystem_utils instead of PathManager

## Key Findings

### Tool Inconsistency
Discovered that `WriteFileTool` is inconsistent with other tools - it returns errors with a "message" key while other tools use "error" key. This could be addressed in a future standardization effort.

### Test Pattern
The correct pattern for tool tests is now:
```python
# Create context
context = ToolContext(agent_id="test", workspace_path=Path("/workspace"))
tool.set_context(context)

# Execute async
result = await tool.execute_async(arguments={"key": "value"})

# Check results
assert "error" in result  # or "message" for WriteFileTool
```

## Impact
- Re-enabled 66 previously disabled tests
- Improved test coverage for all agent tools
- Provides clear examples for future tool test development
- Identified tool standardization opportunity
