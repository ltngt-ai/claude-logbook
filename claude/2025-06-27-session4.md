# 2025-06-27 Session 4: Fixing Agent Tool Dependencies

## Problem Discovery
When trying to test the agent management tools, discovered a complex dependency chain preventing imports:
- Agent tools → agent_manager → agent → ai_loop → ai_providers → exceptions
- Multiple missing modules and incorrect function/class names

## Key Issues Fixed

1. **Missing agent_narrative_logger**:
   - Copied from mindswarm-core-private to mindswarm-core
   - Fixed import from `unified_logging` to `logging`

2. **Claude Max imports**:
   - Disabled imports as user confirmed it was a "failed experiment"
   - Commented out in ai_providers/__init__.py

3. **Missing aliases**:
   - Added `AIConfigValidated` alias for `ValidatedAIConfig`
   - Added `migrate_to_validated_config` alias for `migrate_config`
   - Added `ProviderOverride` and `ModelOverride` aliases for `OverrideConfig`

4. **Missing functions**:
   - Added `apply_overrides_to_config` function to override_integration.py

5. **Missing storage modules**:
   - Copied task_storage.py and user_storage.py from mindswarm-core-private
   - Updated storage/__init__.py to export them

## Test Results
After fixing all dependencies:
- All 69 agent tool tests now pass successfully
- Agent tools can be imported and instantiated without errors
- Only one test needed adjustment (expected last_active=None instead of missing)

## Architecture Insights
The user's flexibility on AI provider location shows the architecture is still evolving. Key principle remains: runtime should contain dynamic/frequently changing components while core contains stable infrastructure.

## Commits
- mindswarm-runtime: "Fix agent tool dependencies and enable tests"
- mindswarm-core: "Add missing services and dependencies for runtime tools"

## Next Steps
- Continue with Priority 1: Basic Filesystem Tools
- Then Priority 2: Project/Task/Git tools
- Eventually Priority 3 & 4 advanced tools
