## UI Refactoring Completed

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Removed Old/New App Split**
   - Consolidated everything to single App.tsx
   - Deleted AppNew.tsx and mindswarm-client.ts
   - Renamed all New* components to remove "New" prefix
   - All references updated to use ui-agent-client

2. **Fixed WebSocket Connection Issues**
   - User registration now working with unique aliases (web-{timestamp})
   - Fixed "Not connected to UI Agent" errors
   - Added connection state checking before data loading
   - Removed duplicate isConnected method

3. **Fixed Data Response Handling**
   - All API methods updated to handle nested responses
   - Pattern: check `response.data?.field || response.field`
   - Workspaces now display correctly (tested with 104 workspaces)
   - Projects, agents, tasks all loading properly

4. **Cleanup**
   - Removed all debug console.log statements
   - Created workspace bulk delete utility (saved in temp/)
   - Cleaned up test data (deleted 104 test workspaces)

### Backend Issues Discovered

1. **Orphaned Projects** (Critical)
   - Projects persist after workspace deletion
   - No cascade delete implemented
   - Created analysis script: `analyze_orphaned_projects.py`
   - GitHub issue: `orphaned-projects-issue.md`

2. **Project Manager Not Created** (Critical)
   - Managed projects don't spawn PM agent
   - `is_managed=true` sent correctly by both CLI and UI
   - Server returns `project_manager_agent_id: null`
   - GitHub issue: `project-manager-not-created-issue.md`

### Code Quality Notes
- User provided important feedback: "Can you please do basic tests before saying something is done"
- Learned to test thoroughly before claiming completion
- Compilation and runtime testing are both essential

### Files Modified
- src/App.tsx - Consolidated main app
- src/lib/ui-agent-client.ts - Fixed duplicate method
- src/lib/api.ts - Updated all API methods for nested responses
- src/hooks/useDataRefresh.ts - Added connection checking
- src/components/views/*.tsx - Removed "New" prefix from all views
- src/components/temp/DeleteAllWorkspaces.tsx - Created cleanup utility

### Next Steps
Need to switch to mindswarm-core-private to fix:
1. Implement cascade delete for workspaces
2. Fix project manager agent creation
3. Both are blocking proper system functionality
