# Daily Log - January 6, 2025

## Session Start
- Resumed from previous conversation that implemented the MindSwarm repository split
- All repositories have been created and pushed to GitHub @ltngt-ai organization
- GitHub CLI authenticated with ltngt-ai-agent account

## Current State
- **Completed**: Repository extraction, creation, and initial push
- **Pending**: Cleanup of AIWhisperer, public sync, CI/CD setup

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Claude Logbook Repository
- Created private repository `claude-logbook` for my working notes
- Set up directory structure: daily/, notes/, issues/, ideas/
- This will help maintain context across session resets

### 2. Analyzed Cleanup Requirements
Identified major cleanup tasks for AIWhisperer:
- 67 test files in root directory need organizing
- Debug scripts and analysis files scattered
- Hundreds of log files need archiving
- Development documentation needs consolidation
- MCP configuration files need organizing

## Next Steps
1. Update CLAUDE.md to document the logbook repository
2. Test the public sync process (dry run first)
3. Begin systematic cleanup of AIWhisperer
4. Set up CI/CD workflows for new repositories

## Technical Notes
- The sync_to_public.sh script is ready but untested
- All repositories use HTTPS remotes (not SSH) due to key issues
- Git config shows commits attributed to "Claude (AI Agent) <claude@ltngt.ai>"

## Issues Encountered
None so far in this session.

## Ideas for Improvement
- Consider creating a cleanup script to automate AIWhisperer organization
- May want to archive the entire AIWhisperer state before cleanup
- Could set up GitHub Actions to automate the monthly sync

## Work Completed (Continued)

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added documentation about the claude-logbook repository
- Specified the daily log format and directory structure
- Emphasized the importance of regular commits for context preservation

### 4. Tested Public Sync Process
- Dry run completed successfully
- Initial sync failed with permission error (resolved)
- Successfully synced after permissions were updated
- Both mindswarm-core and mindswarm-ui are now publicly available
- Created release tags v2025-06 for both repositories

### 5. First Public Release Complete! ðŸŽ‰
- mindswarm-core: https://github.com/ltngt-ai/mindswarm-core
- mindswarm-ui: https://github.com/ltngt-ai/mindswarm-ui
- Release notes generated at MINDSWARM_RELEASE_2025-06.md
- Both repos include full source code with no artificial limitations

## Issues Encountered (Updated)
- **Permission Error**: RESOLVED - User granted write permissions to public repos
- Sync script works perfectly now

## Work Completed (Continued)

### 6. Major AIWhisperer Cleanup
Created and executed cleanup script that:
- Organized 21 Python test files into tests/ directory structure

Session complete - awaiting next steps from user

## Session Resumed - Backend Cleanup Phase

### 9. Backend Cleanup Implementation
User requested complete cleanup of mindswarm-core-private backend to focus exclusively on async agent workflows over WebSocket.

**Cleanup Script Created**: `cleanup_backend.py`
- Removed entire CLI interface directory
- Removed conversation replay system
- Removed legacy model capabilities
- Removed AST/code analysis tools
- Removed plan/RFC tools
- Updated 92 files from ai_whisperer imports to mindswarm
- Removed 18,000+ lines of legacy code

**Structured Logging System**: Created `src/mindswarm/core/structured_logging.py`
- JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs
- Rotating file handler support
- Proper log levels and library configuration
- Replaces hundreds of individual log files

### 10. Fixed Import Issues
- Created fix_duplicate_imports.py to remove duplicate imports
- Fixed 177 files with duplicate import statements
- Fixed circular import in structured_logging.py

### 11. Removed All Slash Command Functionality
User explicitly requested: "lets remove the CLI command and slash command completely"

**Files Modified**:
- `api/main.py`: Removed dispatch_command_handler import and function
- `api/stateless_session_manager.py`: 
  - Removed slash command check in send_user_message (line 589)
  - Removed orphaned command handler code (lines 1608-1797)
  - Removed _send_system_message method (lines 1609-1621)

### Current Backend State
The mindswarm backend is now streamlined to:
- WebSocket API only (no CLI)
- Async agent orchestration
- AI service integration (OpenRouter)
- Essential tools for agent lifecycle
- Structured JSON logging

### Next Steps
1. Test server startup with cleaned backend
2. Clean up configuration system
3. Remove unused dependencies from pyproject.toml

Session continues...

## Test Structure Implementation

### 12. Created Comprehensive Test Structure
**Test Directory Layout**:
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ unit/           # Fast, isolated tests with mocks
â”œâ”€â”€ integration/    # Tests with real dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/           # End-to-end tests
â”œâ”€â”€ performance/   # Performance/load tests
â””â”€â”€ fixtures/      # Shared test data
```

**Test Categories**:
- `@pytest.mark.unit` - No external dependencies, < 100ms
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Component interactions
- `@pytest.mark.network` - WebSocket/HTTP tests
- `@pytest.mark.requires_api` - Needs API keys
- `@pytest.mark.performance` - Load/benchmark tests

### 13. Implemented Core Module Tests
Created unit tests for:
- **exceptions.py**: 19 tests covering all exception classes
  - Fixed AIWhispererError â†’ MindSwarmError with backward compatibility
  - Full coverage of exception hierarchy
  - Special handling for OpenRouter and YAML validation errors
  
- **structured_logging.py**: 20 tests covering:
  - StructuredFormatter JSON output
  - StructuredLogger wrapper functionality
  - Correlation ID tracking
  - Log setup and configuration
  - Fixed datetime deprecation warning (utcnow â†’ now(timezone.utc))

### Test Execution
All tests passing:
```bash
PYTHONPATH=src pytest tests/unit/mindswarm/core/ -v
# Result: 39 passed
```

### Next Steps
- Continue with unit tests for remaining core modules:
  - config.py (largest file, needs comprehensive tests)
  - logging.py (legacy logging system)
  - agent_logger.py
- Create integration tests for WebSocket API
- Set up GitHub Actions for CI testing
