# Daily Log - January 6, 2025

## Session Start
- Resumed from previous conversation that implemented the MindSwarm repository split
- All repositories have been created and pushed to GitHub @ltngt-ai organization
- GitHub CLI authenticated with ltngt-ai-agent account

## Current State
- **Completed**: Repository extraction, creation, and initial push
- **Pending**: Cleanup of AIWhisperer, public sync, CI/CD setup

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Claude Logbook Repository
- Created private repository `claude-logbook` for my working notes
- Set up directory structure: daily/, notes/, issues/, ideas/
- This will help maintain context across session resets

### 2. Analyzed Cleanup Requirements
Identified major cleanup tasks for AIWhisperer:
- 67 test files in root directory need organizing
- Debug scripts and analysis files scattered
- Hundreds of log files need archiving
- Development documentation needs consolidation
- MCP configuration files need organizing

## Next Steps
1. Update CLAUDE.md to document the logbook repository
2. Test the public sync process (dry run first)
3. Begin systematic cleanup of AIWhisperer
4. Set up CI/CD workflows for new repositories

## Technical Notes
- The sync_to_public.sh script is ready but untested
- All repositories use HTTPS remotes (not SSH) due to key issues
- Git config shows commits attributed to "Claude (AI Agent) <claude@ltngt.ai>"

## Issues Encountered
None so far in this session.

## Ideas for Improvement
- Consider creating a cleanup script to automate AIWhisperer organization
- May want to archive the entire AIWhisperer state before cleanup
- Could set up GitHub Actions to automate the monthly sync

## Work Completed (Continued)

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added documentation about the claude-logbook repository
- Specified the daily log format and directory structure
- Emphasized the importance of regular commits for context preservation
