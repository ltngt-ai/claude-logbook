# Daily Log - January 6, 2025

## Session Start
- Resumed from previous conversation that implemented the MindSwarm repository split
- All repositories have been created and pushed to GitHub @ltngt-ai organization
- GitHub CLI authenticated with ltngt-ai-agent account

## Current State
- **Completed**: Repository extraction, creation, and initial push
- **Pending**: Cleanup of AIWhisperer, public sync, CI/CD setup

## Work Completed

### 1. Created Claude Logbook Repository
- Created private repository `claude-logbook` for my working notes
- Set up directory structure: daily/, notes/, issues/, ideas/
- This will help maintain context across session resets

### 2. Analyzed Cleanup Requirements
Identified major cleanup tasks for AIWhisperer:
- 67 test files in root directory need organizing
- Debug scripts and analysis files scattered
- Hundreds of log files need archiving
- Development documentation needs consolidation
- MCP configuration files need organizing

## Next Steps
1. Update CLAUDE.md to document the logbook repository
2. Test the public sync process (dry run first)
3. Begin systematic cleanup of AIWhisperer
4. Set up CI/CD workflows for new repositories

## Technical Notes
- The sync_to_public.sh script is ready but untested
- All repositories use HTTPS remotes (not SSH) due to key issues
- Git config shows commits attributed to "Claude (AI Agent) <claude@ltngt.ai>"

## Issues Encountered
None so far in this session.

## Ideas for Improvement
- Consider creating a cleanup script to automate AIWhisperer organization
- May want to archive the entire AIWhisperer state before cleanup
- Could set up GitHub Actions to automate the monthly sync

## Work Completed (Continued)

### 3. Updated CLAUDE.md
- Added documentation about the claude-logbook repository
- Specified the daily log format and directory structure
- Emphasized the importance of regular commits for context preservation

### 4. Tested Public Sync Process
- Dry run completed successfully
- Initial sync failed with permission error (resolved)
- Successfully synced after permissions were updated
- Both mindswarm-core and mindswarm-ui are now publicly available
- Created release tags v2025-06 for both repositories

### 5. First Public Release Complete! ðŸŽ‰
- mindswarm-core: https://github.com/ltngt-ai/mindswarm-core
- mindswarm-ui: https://github.com/ltngt-ai/mindswarm-ui
- Release notes generated at MINDSWARM_RELEASE_2025-06.md
- Both repos include full source code with no artificial limitations

## Issues Encountered (Updated)
- **Permission Error**: RESOLVED - User granted write permissions to public repos
- Sync script works perfectly now

## Work Completed (Continued)

### 6. Major AIWhisperer Cleanup
Created and executed cleanup script that:
- Organized 21 Python test files into tests/ directory structure
- Moved 44 conversation test files to scripts/conversations/test_corpus/
- Archived all log files to archive/logs/
- Archived debug scripts to archive/debug_scripts/
- Archived development documentation to archive/development_docs/
- Organized setup scripts into scripts/setup/
- Moved MCP configs to config/mcp/
- Removed temporary directories and files

Root directory is now clean with only essential files and directories!

### 7. Set Up CI/CD Workflows
Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflows for:

**mindswarm-core-private:**
- CI workflow: Python 3.10-3.12 testing, linting, security scanning
- Monthly sync workflow: Automated public releases on 1st of each month
- Release workflow: Automated PyPI publishing
- Dependabot config: Weekly dependency updates

**mindswarm-ui-private:**
- CI workflow: Node 18.x-20.x testing, linting, E2E tests
- Dependabot config: Weekly dependency updates

All workflows include:
- Proper caching for faster builds
- Security scanning
- Test coverage reporting
- Artifact uploading

### 8. Migration Complete! ðŸš€
Created comprehensive summary document of the entire migration:
- 9 repositories successfully created and configured
- First public release (v2025-06) successfully published
- Full CI/CD automation in place
- AIWhisperer cleaned up and ready for archival
- All goals from REPO_SPLIT_PLAN.md achieved

## Summary
This was a major milestone - successfully transitioned from AIWhisperer monorepo to the MindSwarm multi-repo architecture. The new structure provides:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Automated monthly public releases
- Modern CI/CD pipelines
- Full OSS functionality with no artificial limits
- Premium tier for enhanced UI/UX

Ready for the public launch of MindSwarm!
