# AI Provider Extension - Continued Implementation

Date: 2025-06-25

## Summary

Continued work on the AI Provider Extension (#281) after investigating Claude Max integration options.

## Claude Max Investigation (#286)

### Findings
1. **OAuth Tokens**: The ~/.claude/.credentials.json contains web-only OAuth tokens (sk-ant-oat01-*)
2. **Authentication Flow**: Claude.ai uses Google Sign-In → internal OAuth tokens
3. **Cloudflare Protection**: All programmatic access is blocked
4. **Claude CLI**: Works without tools, making it useless for agents

### Key Learning
- Claude.ai OAuth tokens are NOT API tokens
- The CLI would need complex MCP permission system for tools
- OpenRouter remains the only viable solution

## Configuration Schema Implementation (#288)

Successfully implemented Pydantic validation for AI configurations:

### Key Components
1. **AIConfigSchema**: Pydantic model with comprehensive validation
   - Temperature: 0.0-2.0
   - Token limits with warnings
   - Reasoning configuration nested model
   - SecretStr for API key security

2. **ValidatedAIConfig**: Backward-compatible wrapper
   - Maintains same interface as AIConfig
   - Validates on creation and updates
   - Clear error messages

3. **Migration Utilities**: Smooth transition path
   - migrate_config() for any format
   - validate_existing_config() for checking
   - Factory function for new code

### Benefits
- Early error detection at config creation
- Type safety with IDE support
- API keys protected from logging
- Consistent validation across providers

## Provider/Model Override System (#289)

Implemented a comprehensive runtime override system:

### Architecture
1. **Four Override Scopes** (precedence order):
   - Request: Thread-local for single calls
   - Agent: Specific agent configuration
   - Project: All agents in a project
   - Global: System-wide defaults

2. **Key Components**:
   - `OverrideConfig`: Dataclass for override settings
   - `ConfigOverrideManager`: Thread-safe singleton
   - `OverrideAwareAIService`: Transparent wrapper
   - Automatic integration with AI loop factory

3. **Thread Safety**:
   - Singleton pattern with locks
   - Thread-local storage for request overrides
   - No interference between concurrent requests

### Usage Examples
```python
# Global override
set_global_override(model_id="claude-3-opus")

# Project override
set_project_override("project-123", provider="anthropic")

# Temporary override
with temporary_override(temperature=0.9):
    result = await agent.process()
```

### Integration
- Seamlessly integrated with existing AI execution pipeline
- Agent context (project_id, agent_id) automatically captured
- No changes needed to existing agent code
- Tools provided for agents to manage overrides

## Architecture Insights

The provider system is well-designed:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Provider factory pattern works well
- Easy to add new providers
- Good abstraction with AIService base class

## Token Tracking Implementation (#290)

Integrated the existing token tracking system with AI providers:

### Implementation
- Automatic tracking in AI loop after each completion
- Extracts usage data from provider responses
- Tracks prompt, completion, reasoning, and image tokens
- Calculates costs based on model pricing
- Records metadata (finish reason, tool usage, etc.)

### Key Features
- No code changes needed in providers (they already return usage data)
- Thread-safe global tracker instance
- Session and historical data tracking
- Aggregation by agent, project, and model
- Cost calculation using model pricing info

## Dynamic Model Discovery (#291)

Added tools to discover AI models dynamically from providers:

### Implementation
- Created `list_available_models` tool for querying providers
- Created `get_model_capabilities` tool for detailed model info
- Uses existing model registry infrastructure
- Intelligent reasoning detection with multiple heuristics
- 1-hour caching with force refresh option

### Key Features
- Automatic capability detection from provider data
- Merges static configuration with dynamic information
- Detects reasoning support through patterns and keywords
- Standardized model information format
- Easy to extend to new providers

## Summary

Successfully completed all items from the AI Provider Extension roadmap (#281):

1. ✅ Base Provider Interface (#282)
2. ✅ OpenRouter Integration (#283)
3. ✅ Anthropic Direct Integration (#284)
4. ✅ Reasoning/Thinking Support (#285)
5. ✅ Claude Max Provider (#286) - Investigated, not viable
6. ✅ Model Context Protocol Support (#287) - Via tools
7. ✅ Configuration Schema (#288)
8. ✅ Provider/Model Override (#289)
9. ✅ Token Tracking (#290)
10. ✅ Dynamic Model Discovery (#291)

### Architectural Achievements
- Clean provider abstraction with factory pattern
- Comprehensive configuration validation with Pydantic
- Runtime override system with multiple scopes
- Automatic token tracking and cost calculation
- Dynamic model discovery with intelligent capability detection
- Tools follow YAML + Python pattern for auto-discovery

### Lessons Learned
- Claude.ai OAuth tokens are web-only, not API tokens
- Claude CLI lacks tool support, making it unsuitable for agents
- OpenRouter remains the best option for multi-provider access
- YAML tool configuration provides better maintainability
- Model capabilities can be intelligently detected from metadata

## Technical Notes

- Pydantic v2 deprecates class Config in favor of model_config dict
- Provider factory now accepts dict configs with auto-validation
- Circular import avoided by importing ValidatedAIConfig inside methods
- SecretStr prevents accidental API key exposure in logs/repr
- Override system uses wrapper pattern for transparency
- Tools added to context_management category

## Code Quality

The codebase maintains high quality:
- Comprehensive test coverage (18 tests for override system)
- Good documentation with examples
- Clear error messages
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Security best practices (SecretStr, no API key logging)
- Thread-safe implementation
