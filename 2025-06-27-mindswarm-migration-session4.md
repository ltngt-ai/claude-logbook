# MindSwarm Migration Session 4 - Priority 2 Tools Complete
Date: 2025-06-27

## Summary
Successfully completed Priority 2 tools migration (project management & knowledge packs) and fixed critical YAML metadata loading issue for runtime tools.

## Achievements

### 1. Priority 2 Tools Migration âœ…
Created and deployed 4 tools:

**Project Management Tools:**
- `create_project` - Full project initialization with:
  - Directory structure (basic, python, web, documentation templates)
  - Git repository initialization
  - MindSwarm metadata folder
  - Initial knowledge pack generation
  - Project Manager agent spawning
- `list_projects` - Project discovery with metadata, Git status, and agent info

**Knowledge Pack Tools:**
- `list_knowledge_packs` - Discovers packs from core, project, and custom sources with filtering
- `explore_knowledge_pack` - Deep content exploration with sections, rules extraction, and search

### 2. Critical Infrastructure Fix ðŸ”§
Fixed runtime tool YAML metadata loading issue:

**Problem:** Runtime tools couldn't access their YAML metadata (descriptions, ai_prompts) because they were loaded as dynamic modules with incorrect module paths.

**Solution:** Modified `_create_python_tool_instance` in agent_manager.py to inject YAML metadata after tool instantiation:
```python
# Inject YAML metadata from the loaded component
yaml_path = loaded_component.data.get("_source_path")
if yaml_path:
    tool_instance._yaml_path = Path(yaml_path)
    # Extract YAML metadata from the loaded component data
    yaml_metadata = {}
    for key, value in loaded_component.data.items():
        if not key.startswith('_'):  # Skip internal fields
            yaml_metadata[key] = value
    tool_instance._yaml_metadata = yaml_metadata
```

This ensures:
- âœ… AI prompts are accessible to agents
- âœ… Tool descriptions work properly
- âœ… Hot reload registration functions
- âœ… All metadata fields available

### 3. Schema Updates
- Updated tool schema to use only 'name' field (removed redundant 'id' requirement)
- Fixed metadata validation (version field, datetime formats)

## Testing Results
- All 4 Priority 2 tools pass schema validation
- 8 total tools now loaded in agent registry
- YAML metadata properly accessible for all tools
- Hot reload confirmed working in development mode

## Current State
**Completed:**
- Priority 1: Communication Tools âœ…
- Priority 1: Agent Management Tools âœ…
- Priority 1: Filesystem Tools âœ…
- Priority 2: Project Management + Knowledge Packs âœ…

**Next:**
- Priority 2: Task Management Tools + Scheduling
- Priority 2: Git Tools

## Key Learnings
1. Runtime tool loading requires special handling for YAML metadata injection
2. The `ai_prompt` field is critical - it's not just documentation, it's how agents learn to use tools
3. Virtual environments per repository is the correct strategy
4. Tool schema validation helps catch issues early but needs to match actual usage
