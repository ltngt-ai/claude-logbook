# 2025-06-10: CLI Assistant Integration Complete

## Summary
Completed the integration of the CLI with the new agent naming system. The assistant commands now use aliases instead of raw IDs, and the status command shows complete agent info from the backend.

## Key Changes

### 1. CLI Assistant Commands Updated
- Modified `assistant_commands.py` to use "assistant" alias when sending messages
- Both non-interactive and interactive chat modes now use aliases
- No more raw agent IDs in the CLI

### 2. Enhanced Status Command
Created `_get_assistant_info()` method that:
- Calls `mindswarm.mail.listRecipients` API to get agent info
- Shows the full agent ID (FQN format)
- Lists all configured aliases
- Displays the project ID
- Provides clear usage instructions

Status output now shows:
```
Agent ID: eaaaf65e-1155-4ae5-b2d8-74ff8da73ece.system-assistant-0ca450bb-1d8b-4851-b43d-e90c49408a35
Aliases: system, mindswarm, assistant, SystemAssistant, help
Project: eaaaf65e-1155-4ae5-b2d8-74ff8da73ece
```

### 3. Fixed Agent Mail Checking
- Agents now check mail using their FQN, not just their ID
- Fixed `_check_mail_async()` to use `session.metadata.get('fqn', session.agent_id)`
- This ensures agents receive mail sent to their fully qualified names

## Technical Details

### Mail Flow
1. CLI sends to "assistant" alias
2. Backend resolves to FQN: `project_id.agent_id`
3. Mail delivered to agent's FQN inbox
4. Agent checks mail using same FQN

### API Integration
The `list_recipients` method was already implemented in the client:
```python
async def list_recipients(self, project_id: Optional[str] = None) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """List all available mail recipients with their aliases."""
    params = {}
    if project_id:
        params["project_id"] = project_id
    result = await self._call("mindswarm.mail.listRecipients", params)
    return result.get("recipients", [])
```

## Test Results
- ✅ Status command shows full agent info and aliases
- ✅ Mail sent to "assistant" alias is properly resolved
- ✅ Mail delivered to agent's FQN inbox
- ❌ Assistant not responding (agent processor cancelled - separate issue)

## User Feedback Addressed
✅ "update the status check to a directory read from the backend with the entire id and aliases of the system assistant"

## Next Steps
- Investigate why agent processor is being cancelled immediately
- Test interactive chat mode
- Remove WorkspaceProjectService (duplicate project system)
