# Priority 1 & 2 Tool Migration Complete - June 27, 2025

## Major Milestone Achieved

All Priority 1 and Priority 2 tools have been successfully migrated from mindswarm-core-private to mindswarm-runtime!

## Final Statistics

**Total Tools in Runtime: 41**

### By Category:
- **communication**: 2 tools (check_mail, send_mail)
- **advanced_communication**: 2 tools (list_mailboxes, reply_mail) 
- **agent**: 5 tools (create_agent, list_agents, terminate_agent, get_agent_status, list_agent_types)
- **filesystem**: 6 tools (read_file, write_file, list_directory, delete_file, find_pattern, search_files)
- **git**: 14 tools (all git operations)
- **project_management**: 3 tools (create_project, list_projects, import_project)
- **task_management**: 4 tools (create_task, update_task_status, get_task_info, list_project_tasks)
- **scheduling**: 3 tools (schedule_wakeup, list_scheduled_wakeups, cancel_scheduled_wakeup)
- **knowledge**: 2 tools (list_knowledge_packs, explore_knowledge_pack)

## Key Accomplishments

### Architecture Clarification
- Understood that ALL tools and agents belong in runtime, not core
- Core is purely the engine
- Runtime contains all dynamic content

### Missing Tools Found & Migrated
1. **Communication tools** - Found that check_mail and send_mail were not yet in runtime
2. **Filesystem search tools** - Added find_pattern and search_files
3. **Project import** - Added import_project tool
4. **Git tools** - Migrated all 14 git tools (not just the initial 3)

### Quality Improvements
- All tools follow consistent YAML schema format
- OpenAI-compatible parameter schemas throughout
- Comprehensive AI prompts with examples
- Proper async implementation patterns
- Security validations (path traversal, etc.)
- Context-aware operations

## Next Steps

### Priority 3: GitHub Tools
- create_issue
- create_pr  
- list_issues
- Plus 5 more GitHub tools in core-private

### Priority 3: Analysis Tools  
- analyze_code
- find_files
- Plus 3 more analysis tools in core-private

### Priority 4: Remaining Tools
- AI tools (2)
- Auth tools (7)
- Code execution (2)
- Context management (5)
- Janitor (4)
- Self management (1)
- Team (2)
- UI (4)

## Technical Notes
- Fixed ComponentDiscovery path handling bug
- Enhanced check_mail with include_internal parameter
- All tools properly discovered and loadable
- Ready for agent integration testing
