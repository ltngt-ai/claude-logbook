# Mind-Swarm Knowledge Evolution Project

## Project Overview
Implementing a hyperlinked knowledge system that allows Mind-Swarm agents to navigate and discover knowledge dynamically, similar to how humans browse Wikipedia.

## Vision
Transform Mind-Swarm agents from static knowledge consumers to dynamic learners who can:
- Navigate knowledge via hyperlinks
- Discover relevant information on demand
- Trust external knowledge based on validation
- Contribute back to community knowledge

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Enhancement âœ… COMPLETE (2025-01-29)
- Enhanced knowledge schema with hyperlinks
- Updated explore_knowledge_pack tool
- Created example packs
- Built validation system
- **Result**: Agents can now navigate hyperlinked knowledge

### Phase 2: Reference Librarian Agent (Weeks 3-4) ðŸš§ NEXT
- Create specialist agent for knowledge discovery
- Implement external knowledge fetching
- Add trust evaluation
- Build caching system

### Phase 3: Archivist/Curator Agent (Weeks 5-6)
- Knowledge maintenance and updates
- Usage analytics
- Community contribution system
- Knowledge evolution tracking

### Phase 4: Security Council (Weeks 7-8)
- Multi-agent security validation
- Voting mechanisms
- Trust score computation
- Quarantine system

### Phase 5: External Integration (Weeks 9-10)
- GitHub knowledge packs
- NPM integration
- Web content processing
- API documentation import

### Phase 6: Production Ready (Weeks 11-12)
- Performance optimization
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation
- Community tools

## Key Innovations

### 1. Hyperlink Syntax
```
[[#section]]              - Internal section
[[pack#section]]          - Cross-pack reference
[[https://example.com]]   - External link
```

### 2. Trust Levels
- **core**: Built-in, fully trusted
- **verified**: Security validated
- **community**: Known source
- **experimental**: New/testing
- **untrusted**: Unknown source

### 3. Manifest System
```yaml
manifest:
  provides: [react, hooks, patterns]
  dependencies: [javascript-basics]
  trust_level: core
  size: 15KB
```

### 4. Agent Specialization
- **Reference Librarian**: Finds and validates knowledge
- **Archivist**: Maintains and improves knowledge
- **Security Council**: Validates safety

## Technical Decisions

1. **No Breaking Changes**: Enhanced schema is backward compatible
2. **YAML Format**: Human-readable, agent-parseable
3. **Distributed Storage**: Runtime + Project knowledge
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Old tools still work
5. **Agent-First Design**: Built for AI consumption

## Recovery Story
This project was partially lost due to a git error but successfully recovered from Claude Code session logs (JSONL). This demonstrated the value of:
- Session logs as backup
- Incremental development
- Comprehensive documentation

## Metrics & Goals

### Success Metrics
- Agent context efficiency (reduce by 50%)
- Knowledge discovery time (<2 seconds)
- Trust accuracy (>95%)
- Community contributions (100+ packs)

### Quality Standards
- All packs must pass schema validation
- Security review for trust promotion
- Performance benchmarks for large packs
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Future Vision
Eventually, Mind-Swarm agents will:
- Learn from any documentation source
- Build project-specific knowledge graphs
- Share learned patterns with the community
- Adapt knowledge based on task success
