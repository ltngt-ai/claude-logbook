# Continuation Protocol Debug Session

## Date: 2025-06-08

### Session Summary
Extensive debugging session to investigate why the task-level continuation protocol wasn't working fully in MindSwarm agents.

### Initial Problem
- Agents were only completing Phase 1 of a 3-phase task
- They were using tool call continuation instead of task-level continuation with CONTINUE/TERMINATE signals
- Test 004 (task-continuation-protocol) was failing

### Key Discoveries

1. **Continuation Protocol Working Partially**:
   - After implementing proper continuation detection, agents now complete Phase 1 and Phase 2
   - Phase 3 still not executing, suggesting agents send TERMINATE after Phase 2

2. **Two Types of Continuation**:
   - Tool-level continuation: When `finish_reason: 'tool_calls'` (this was already working)
   - Task-level continuation: Using explicit CONTINUE/TERMINATE signals in response

3. **Different Protocols for Different Models**:
   - Structured output models: Continuation is a native JSON field
   - Non-structured models: Continuation JSON is appended to response text

### Fixes Implemented

1. **Added Continuation Detection Logic** in `agent_manager.py`:
   ```python
   # For structured responses
   if isinstance(result, dict) and "continuation" in result:
       continuation = result.get("continuation", {})
       if continuation.get("status") == "CONTINUE":
           should_continue = True
   
   # For non-structured responses
   continuation_match = re.search(r'\{"continuation":\s*\{[^}]+\}\}', final_content)
   if continuation_match:
       continuation_json = json.loads(continuation_match.group())
       if continuation_json.get("continuation", {}).get("status") == "CONTINUE":
           should_continue = True
   ```

2. **Task Queuing for Continuation**:
   - When CONTINUE detected, queue a continuation task
   - Pass context about parent task and previous reason

3. **Added Agent Logging**:
   - Integrated `AgentLogger` into async agent manager
   - Added logging for processor start, task completion, continuation detection
   - Fixed `AgentSession` to include `agent_type` field

### Current Status

**Progress**:
- ✅ Agents receive and understand continuation protocol
- ✅ Phase 1: Agents create data.txt
- ✅ Phase 2: Agents create summary.txt with continuation
- ❌ Phase 3: Agents don't create status.txt

**Working Theory**:
The agents are likely sending TERMINATE after Phase 2 instead of another CONTINUE. This could be because:
1. They don't maintain awareness of remaining phases
2. The continuation prompt doesn't preserve enough context
3. They interpret Phase 2 completion as task completion

### Next Steps

1. **Examine Agent Decision Making**:
   - Need to see actual agent responses to understand why they TERMINATE after Phase 2
   - Agent logs would be helpful but aren't being created (separate issue)

2. **Improve Context Preservation**:
   - Consider adding phase tracking to continuation context
   - Ensure agents understand there are 3 phases total

3. **Debug Agent Logging**:
   - Agent logger is integrated but logs aren't appearing
   - May need to debug path issues or initialization

### Test Results
- Test 001: 2/4 agent types working (assistant and software-engineer)
- Test 003: Tool call continuation working perfectly
- Test 004: Task continuation partially working (2/3 phases complete)
