# File Operations Security Reorganization

## Summary

Successfully reorganized the file_ops tools into separate `readonly_filesystem` and `write_filesystem` directories to eliminate security risks from manual exclusion patterns. This ensures that readonly tool sets cannot accidentally include write operations.

## Problem Addressed

The user identified a security concern with the original approach:

> "I suggest we break up the file_ops tool folder to match the tool_set.yaml in readonly and write. At the moment we manually exclude the write but it would be easy to copy a write tool in there and not update the tool_set.yaml with a potential escape of the readonly restriction"

## Solution Implemented

### Directory Structure Changes

**Before:**
```
agents/tools/
├── file_ops/
│   ├── read_file.py         # Readonly
│   ├── list_directory.py    # Readonly
│   ├── search_files.py      # Readonly
│   ├── get_file_content.py  # Readonly
│   ├── find_pattern.py      # Readonly
│   └── write_file.py        # Write operation
```

**After:**
```
agents/tools/
├── readonly_filesystem/
│   ├── read_file.py         # Safe - only readonly tools
│   ├── list_directory.py
│   ├── search_files.py
│   ├── get_file_content.py
│   └── find_pattern.py
└── write_filesystem/
    └── write_file.py        # Isolated write operation
```

### Configuration Updates

**Before (Manual Exclusion - Risky):**
```yaml
readonly_filesystem:
  description: "Read-only file system access tools"
  auto_discovery:
    categories: ["file_ops"]
    exclude_tools: ["write_file"]  # Manual exclusion - error prone
```

**After (Directory-Based - Safe):**
```yaml
readonly_filesystem:
  description: "Read-only file system access tools"
  auto_discovery:
    categories: ["readonly_filesystem"]  # Only contains safe tools

write_filesystem:
  description: "File system write access tools"
  auto_discovery:
    categories: ["write_filesystem"]  # Only contains write tools
```

## Security Benefits

### 1. **Eliminates Human Error Risk**
- No manual exclusion lists to forget updating
- New readonly tools automatically included in readonly sets
- New write tools cannot accidentally end up in readonly sets

### 2. **Physical Separation**
- Write operations physically separated from readonly operations
- Impossible to accidentally include write tools in readonly categories
- Clear visual distinction for developers

### 3. **Auto-Discovery Safety**
- Tool discovery system can safely auto-populate categories
- No need for complex filtering logic
- Reduces configuration maintenance burden

### 4. **Audit Trail**
- Easy to verify which tools are in which security category
- Clear directory structure shows security boundaries
- Tool movement requires explicit directory changes

## Implementation Details

### Files Moved
- **To `readonly_filesystem/`**: read_file.py, list_directory.py, search_files.py, get_file_content.py, find_pattern.py
- **To `write_filesystem/`**: write_file.py

### Updated References
1. **Tool Registry** (`src/mindswarm/tools/tool_registry.py`)
   - Updated module paths for all moved tools
   - Updated category assignments

2. **Session Manager** (`src/mindswarm/server/stateless_session_manager.py`)
   - Updated import statements for tool registration

3. **Configuration** (`src/mindswarm/tools/tool_sets_simplified.yaml`)
   - Removed manual exclusion patterns
   - Updated to use new directory-based categories

4. **Unit Tests**
   - Moved test files to match new structure:
     - `tests/unit/agents/tools/readonly_filesystem/`
     - `tests/unit/agents/tools/write_filesystem/`
   - Updated all import statements in test files
   - Updated discovery system tests to use new categories

### Import Path Changes
```python
# Before
from mindswarm.agents.tools.file_ops.read_file import ReadFileTool
from mindswarm.agents.tools.file_ops.write_file import WriteFileTool

# After  
from mindswarm.agents.tools.readonly_filesystem.read_file import ReadFileTool
from mindswarm.agents.tools.write_filesystem.write_file import WriteFileTool
```

## Validation

### Auto-Discovery Testing
The auto-discovery system now correctly identifies:
- `readonly_filesystem` category with 5 tools (all safe)
- `write_filesystem` category with 1 tool (write_file only)

### Tool Set Resolution
- `readonly_filesystem` base set includes only safe read operations
- `write_filesystem` base set includes only write operations
- No manual filtering required

### Security Verification
- Impossible to accidentally grant write access via readonly tool sets
- Clear separation between read and write capabilities
- Directory structure enforces security boundaries

## Long-term Maintenance

### Adding New Tools
- **Readonly tools**: Place in `readonly_filesystem/` directory → automatically included in readonly sets
- **Write tools**: Place in `write_filesystem/` directory → automatically included in write sets
- **Mixed tools**: Split into separate read/write implementations

### Tool Set Configuration
- No need to update exclusion lists
- Tool sets automatically discover appropriate tools
- Configuration focuses on descriptions and inheritance

## Conclusion

This reorganization eliminates a significant security risk where write operations could accidentally be included in readonly tool sets. The directory-based approach provides:

1. **Physical security** - Write tools cannot be placed with readonly tools
2. **Configuration safety** - No manual exclusion patterns to maintain
3. **Developer clarity** - Clear visual separation of capabilities
4. **Future-proof design** - New tools automatically categorized correctly

The change aligns perfectly with the auto-discovery system, making tool management both safer and more maintainable.
