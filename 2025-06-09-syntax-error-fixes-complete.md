## Result
- All changes committed and pushed to main branch
- Main branch is now completely clean of syntax errors
- `flake8` returns 0 (no errors)
- Achieved the user's goal: "get a main clean and working, so we can work on multiple features with a solid main to merge into going forward"

## Next Steps
With a clean main branch established, the project is now ready for:
- Feature development on separate branches
- Confident merging back to a stable main
- Parallel development workflows
