# Project Structure and Foundation Fixes Summary

## Date: 2025-06-08

## Summary
Fixed fundamental issues with project creation, structure, and agent configurations that were blocking proper testing of the continuation protocol.

## Key Fixes

### 1. Project Structure Migration
- **Old Structure**: AIWhisperer legacy with alice/patricia/tessa agent directories
- **New Structure**: Clean Mind-Swarm structure with:
  ```
  .mindswarm/
  ├── agents/      # Agent-specific data
  ├── tasks/       # Task tracking
  ├── context/     # Context management
  ├── logs/        # Project logs
  └── artifacts/   # Generated artifacts
  ```

### 2. Fixed _create_whisper_structure Error
- **Issue**: Missing method causing project creation to fail
- **Fix**: Updated `create_new_project` to use existing `_create_project_structure` method
- **Result**: Projects now create successfully with proper structure

### 3. Removed 'default' Project Special Handling
- **Issue**: Security loophole allowing agents without valid projects
- **Fix**: All operations now require a valid project with PathManager
- **Impact**: Enforces proper project scope for all agents

### 4. Execute Command Tool Fix
- **Issue**: Commands ran in server directory, not project directory
- **Fix**: Modified execute_command to:
  - Use project workspace directory as default cwd when none specified
  - Validate provided cwd against PathManager allowed paths
  - Log clear warnings when no PathManager available
- **Result**: File operations now happen in correct project directory

### 5. Agent Configuration Fixes
- **Issue**: Only 'a' type agents worked in test 001
- **Root Cause**: p, t, s agent configs missing required name/model fields
- **Fix**: Added missing fields to test agent configurations
- **Impact**: All agent types should now execute tasks properly

## Technical Details

### Modified Files
1. `src/mindswarm/services/workspace/project_manager.py`:
   - Line 126-146: Updated `_create_project_structure` to use Mind-Swarm directories
   - Line 579-583: Fixed project creation to use proper method

2. `src/mindswarm/server/main.py`:
   - Line 318-329: Removed default project special case
   - Enforced project validation for all operations

3. `src/mindswarm/services/agents/agent_manager.py`:
   - Line 331-338: Removed default project exceptions
   - Line 351-353: Simplified PathManager assignment (now required)

4. `src/mindswarm/tools/code_execution/execute_command.py`:
   - Line 91-113: Added PathManager integration for working directory
   - Default to project workspace when no cwd specified
   - Validate cwd against allowed paths

5. Test agent configs:
   - Added name and model fields to project-manager-basic.yaml
   - Added name and model fields to task-manager-basic.yaml  
   - Added name and model fields to software-engineer-basic.yaml

## Remaining Issues

1. **Project Persistence**: Projects created via CLI aren't persisted across server restarts
2. **Tool Directory Context**: Other tools may need similar fixes for directory context
3. **Security**: execute_command path validation is basic - needs sandboxing

## Next Steps

1. Test all agent types can now execute tasks
2. Verify continuation protocol works with fixed foundations
3. Consider more robust sandboxing for execute_command
4. Fix project persistence across server restarts

## Lessons Learned

1. **Foundation First**: Core issues like project structure block everything else
2. **Complete Configs**: Missing required fields cause silent failures
3. **Security by Default**: No special cases for bypassing validation
4. **Tool Context**: Tools need project context to operate correctly
