# Mind-Swarm Task Execution Implementation

Date: 2025-06-08

## Current State Analysis

After running the SimpleTasks test framework, I've identified the core missing functionality:

### What Works
1. ✅ Task creation via `mindswarm.task.create` RPC endpoint
2. ✅ Task storage in server memory 
3. ✅ Agent spawning and lifecycle management
4. ✅ Task orchestrator infrastructure exists

### What's Missing
1. ❌ No task assignment to agents (`task.assign` endpoint)
2. ❌ No mechanism to trigger task execution on agents
3. ❌ Task orchestrator's `execute_task` is a placeholder
4. ❌ No integration between task system and agent manager

## Architecture Overview

The system has these key components:

1. **Server (main.py)**
   - Handles RPC endpoints for tasks
   - Stores tasks in memory: `self.tasks`
   - Has both `agent_manager` and `task_engine` (currently unused)

2. **Task Orchestrator** 
   - Has proper domain models (Task, TaskStatus, TaskConfig)
   - Has `assign_team()` and `execute_task()` methods
   - Execution is currently a placeholder

3. **Agent Manager**
   - Manages agent lifecycle
   - Has message processing infrastructure
   - No awareness of tasks currently

## Implementation Plan

To get basic task execution working:

### Phase 1: Task Assignment
1. Add `task.assign` RPC endpoint to assign task to agent
2. Store assignment in task metadata
3. Update agent state to track assigned tasks

### Phase 2: Task Execution Trigger
1. Add mechanism for agents to check for assigned tasks
2. Implement basic task execution flow:
   - Agent receives task assignment
   - Agent processes task description
   - Agent performs actions (create files, etc.)
   - Agent reports completion

### Phase 3: Integration
1. Connect task orchestrator to agent manager
2. Implement proper task status updates
3. Add task result collection

## Next Steps

Start with a minimal implementation to get the SimpleTasks tests passing:
1. Add task assignment endpoint
2. Modify agent message loop to check for tasks
3. Create simple task executor that can handle file creation tasks
