# Mind-Swarm Test Framework Creation

Date: 2025-06-08

## Summary
Created Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks repository with a comprehensive testing framework for systematically evaluating and improving Mind-Swarm's task execution capabilities.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Agent-Aware Testing
- Tests can run on different agent types (assistant, research) or teams
- Allows comparison of how different agents handle the same task
- Expected outputs can vary per agent type

### 2. Standardized Test Protocol
1. Clean environment setup (removes existing test directories)
2. Create Mind-Swarm project via CLI
3. Spawn configured agent(s)
4. Execute task
5. Collect outputs
6. Compare against expected results
7. Generate metrics (execution time, success rate, etc.)

### 3. Directory Structure
```
Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks/
├── tests/              # Individual test cases
│   └── 001-file-creation/
│       ├── test.sh     # Test execution script
│       ├── task.yaml   # Task definition
│       ├── agents.yaml # Which agents to test
│       ├── expected/   # Expected outputs per agent
│       │   ├── assistant/
│       │   └── research/
│       └── actual/     # Actual outputs (gitignored)
├── agents/             # Reusable agent configurations
│   ├── single/         # Individual agents
│   └── teams/          # Multi-agent teams
├── lib/
│   └── test-harness.sh # Shared test functions
├── results/            # Test metrics in YAML
└── logs/               # Detailed execution logs
```

### 4. First Test Case: File Creation
- Task: Create a README.md for a Python calculator project
- Tests basic file creation capability
- Includes expected outputs showing different agent styles:
  - Assistant: Concise, practical approach
  - Research: Detailed, comprehensive approach

## Technical Implementation

### Test Harness Features
- Color-coded logging (info, success, error, warning)
- Timing functions for performance metrics
- Project/agent creation via Mind-Swarm CLI
- Results collection and comparison
- YAML-based metrics output

### Agent Configuration Format
```yaml
agent:
  type: assistant
  instance_id: test-assistant
  name: "Test Assistant"
  model: gpt-4
  settings:
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 2000
```

### Task Definition Format
```yaml
task:
  id: "create-readme"
  description: "Create a README.md file..."
  requirements:
    - Create README.md
    - Include specific sections
  evaluation_criteria:
    - file_exists: "README.md"
    - contains_title: "Python Calculator"
```

## Current Limitations
1. Task execution not fully implemented in Mind-Swarm yet
2. Using placeholder for actual task execution
3. Metrics collection is basic (mainly timing)
4. Agent communication/coordination not tested yet

## Next Steps
1. Run baseline test with current Mind-Swarm implementation
2. Implement proper task execution monitoring
3. Add more test cases:
   - Code analysis
   - Multi-file operations
   - Error scenarios
   - Multi-agent collaboration
4. Enhance metrics collection (token usage, API calls)
5. Create dashboard for test results visualization

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Reproducible**: Same test conditions every time
2. **Comparable**: Different agents on same tasks
3. **Measurable**: Quantitative metrics for improvement
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new tests and agents
5. **Debuggable**: Comprehensive logging at each step

This framework provides the foundation for data-driven improvement of Mind-Swarm's capabilities.
