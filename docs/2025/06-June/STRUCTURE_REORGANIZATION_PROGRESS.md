# Structure Reorganization Progress - June 7, 2025

## Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Clean Up (COMPLETED ✓)
- Removed `agent_switch_handler_backup.py`
- Removed `alice_assistant.prompt.md.bak`
- Consolidated `async_session_manager_v2.py` → `async_session_manager.py`
- Updated imports in `async_agent_endpoints.py`
- All 441 tests passing

### Phase 2: Move Mailbox to Core (COMPLETED ✓)
- Created `core/communication/` directory
- Moved all mailbox files from `extensions/mailbox/` to `core/communication/`
- Updated 11 files with new import paths:
  - `agent_switch_handler.py`
  - `send_mail.py`, `check_mail.py`, `reply_mail.py`, `send_mail_with_switch.py`
  - `async_session_manager.py`, `synchronous_executor.py`
  - `notification.py`
  - Test files for send_mail and check_mail
- All communication tests passing
- Mailbox now properly recognized as core infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Security-First Design**: Kept `readonly_filesystem/` and `write_filesystem/` tools separate per user feedback - this is an intentional security boundary to prevent accidental permission escalation.

2. **Mailbox as Core**: Moved mailbox from extensions to core because it's fundamental to agent-to-agent and agent-to-user communication, not an optional feature.

### Phase 3: Services Consolidation (COMPLETED ✓)
- Created `services/workspace/` directory
- Moved `file_service.py` and `project_manager.py` from `server/services/`
- Updated imports in 4 files:
  - `workspace_handler.py` - Updated to use mindswarm.services.workspace
  - `project_handlers.py` - Updated relative imports to absolute
  - `project_manager.py` - Fixed model imports
  - `__init__.py` - Updated docstring
- Removed empty `server/services/` directory
- All tests passing

### Phase 4: Light Tool Reorganization (COMPLETED ✓)
- Moved tool registration helpers from `core/communication/tools.py` to `agents/tools/communication/__init__.py`
- Created centralized `tool_registration.py` module with:
  - `register_all_tools()` - Registers all discovered tools
  - `register_core_tools()` - Minimal set for basic operations
  - `register_tool_by_name()` - Register specific tools
- Consolidated duplicate tool registration from both session managers
- Removed obsolete `core/communication/tools.py`
- All tests passing

**Note**: Discovered that `tool_loader.py` and `auto_tool_loader.py` are unused legacy code. The actual system uses tool_discovery + tool_registry. These could be removed in a future cleanup.

## Next Phase: Rename Agent-Specific Components

Will rename components that have agent-specific names (like debbie_observer) to generic names.

## Statistics
- Files cleaned up: 4 (3 backups + 1 obsolete tools.py)
- Files moved: 6 (4 mailbox + 2 services)
- Files created: 1 (tool_registration.py)
- Imports updated: 15 (11 mailbox + 4 services)
- Code consolidated: ~200 lines of duplicate tool registration
- Tests passing: 441/441
- Completion: 4/6 phases done (67%)

## Lessons Learned
- Always understand security implications before merging similar folders
- Core vs extension distinction is important for architecture clarity
- Automated import updates save time and reduce errors
