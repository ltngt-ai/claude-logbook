# Mind-Swarm Core Reorganization Complete

Date: 2025-01-07

## Overview
Successfully completed the final phase of the Mind-Swarm core reorganization, fixing all import paths and test failures after the major structural changes.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Configuration System Migration
- **Removed**: Old `mindswarm.core.config` module completely removed
- **Updated**: `server/main.py` to use new Pydantic-based configuration system
- **Added**: Legacy config adapter function `create_legacy_config()` for backward compatibility
- **Result**: Clean separation between old and new config systems

### 2. Prompt System Restoration
- **Issue**: Prompt system was missing after transfer from AIWhisperer
- **Solution**: Copied `prompt_system.py` from AIWhisperer project
- **Location**: Moved to `services/agents/prompts/` (as it provides agent prompts and personas)
- **Updated**: All imports across codebase to use new location

### 3. Directory Structure Clarification

#### Services Rename for Clarity
- `services/ai` → `services/ai_providers` (clearer purpose)

#### Tools Relocation
- `agents/tools/` → `tools/` (tools are not agent-specific)
- Fixed all relative imports in tools that were using `....extensions`
- Updated all tool imports in source and test files

#### Session Manager Disambiguation
- `server/session_manager.py` → `server/websocket_session_manager.py` (handles WebSocket sessions)
- `services/agents/session_manager.py` → `services/agents/agent_manager.py` (manages agent lifecycles)

#### Class Name Updates
- Removed "async_" prefix from class names since only async agents are supported:
  - `AsyncAgentSessionManager` → `AgentManager`
  - `AsyncAgentSession` → `AgentSession`

### 4. Import Path Updates

#### Source Code Updates
- Fixed imports in `ai_loop.py`: `mindswarm.services.execution` → `mindswarm.services.ai_execution`
- Fixed imports in `agent_manager.py`: `mindswarm.prompt_system` → `mindswarm.services.agents.prompts`
- Updated 8 files to use `mindswarm.services.ai_providers` instead of `mindswarm.services.ai`
- Fixed 5 files with relative imports in tools directory
- Updated multiple MCP integration files to use absolute imports

#### Test Updates
- Updated 10 test files to import from `mindswarm.tools` instead of `mindswarm.agents.tools`
- Fixed 9 test files with patch decorators pointing to old paths
- Updated `test_tool_discovery.py` mock paths from `agents/tools/` to `tools/`
- Renamed old `test_config.py` to avoid conflicts with new config system

### 5. Scripts Created and Used
Created temporary scripts to automate the updates:
- `update_tool_imports.py` - Updated tool imports in source files
- `update_test_tool_imports.py` - Updated tool imports in test files
- `fix_relative_imports.py` - Fixed relative imports in tools directory
- `fix_test_patches.py` - Fixed patch decorators in tests

All scripts were removed after use.

## Final State
- **All 414 unit tests passing**
- **Clean import structure** with no circular dependencies
- **Logical organization** where:
  - Services are stateful, long-running components
  - Tools are stateless utilities
  - Agents have their own dedicated services
  - Configuration is centralized and type-safe

## Key Decisions Made
1. **Prompt system belongs with agents** - It provides agent personas and prompts
2. **Tools are not agent-specific** - Moved to top-level for broader use
3. **Service naming should be clear** - Renamed `ai` to `ai_providers`
4. **No backward compatibility needed** - Per user guidance, implemented new config directly
5. **Async-only support** - Removed async prefixes as only async agents are supported

## Next Steps
The reorganization is complete. The codebase now has a cleaner structure that:
- Clearly separates concerns
- Makes navigation intuitive
- Reduces confusion about component purposes
- Supports future extensibility

Ready for the next phase of development.
