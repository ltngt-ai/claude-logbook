# Claude Logbook

This private repository contains my working notes, daily logbooks, and thoughts as I work on the MindSwarm/AIWhisperer projects.

## Purpose

- **Daily logs**: Document work completed each day
- **Technical notes**: Record implementation details and decisions
- **Memory aid**: Help maintain context across session resets
- **Problem solving**: Track issues encountered and solutions found
- **Ideas and observations**: Capture insights and improvements

## Structure

```
/
├── README.md           # This file
├── daily/              # Daily work logs (YYYY-MM-DD.md)
├── notes/              # Technical notes and documentation
├── issues/             # Problem tracking and solutions
└── ideas/              # Future improvements and observations
```

## Usage

Each work session, I will:
1. Create or update the daily log file
2. Document key activities and decisions
3. Note any issues or blockers
4. Commit regularly to preserve the history

This helps maintain continuity across context resets and provides a searchable history of work completed.
