# Agent Fixes Implementation Summary

## Date: 2025-01-08

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Terminate Command Parameter Mismatch

**Problem**: CLI was sending `agent_fqn` but server expected `agent_id`

**Solution**: Updated server handlers to accept both parameters for compatibility
- Modified `_handle_terminate_agent`, `_handle_get_agent`, `_handle_suspend_agent`, `_handle_resume_agent`
- Added FQN parsing to extract agent_id from fully qualified names

### 2. Implemented Project-Scoped Agents

**Problem**: Agents were stored globally instead of being scoped to projects

**Solution**: Complete refactoring of agent storage and management
- Changed `AgentManager.sessions` from flat dict to nested structure: `{project_id: {agent_id: session}}`
- Added `_resolve_agent_session()` method for FQN-based agent lookup
- Updated all agent operations to use FQN resolution
- Modified agent creation to require `project_id`
- Updated `get_agent_states()` to return FQNs and project information

### 3. Updated Server and CLI Integration

**Server Changes**:
- Agent spawn handler now accepts and requires `project_id`
- List agents handler properly filters by project
- All agent operations support FQN format (project_id.agent_id)

**CLI Changes**:
- Updated `spawn_agent` client method to accept `project_id`
- CLI spawn command already required project, so no changes needed there
- Test harness already passes project ID when spawning agents

## Key Implementation Details

### FQN Resolution
```python
def _resolve_agent_session(self, agent_identifier: str) -> Optional[AgentSession]:
    """Resolve agent session by ID or FQN."""
    if "." in agent_identifier:
        parts = agent_identifier.split(".", 1)
        if len(parts) == 2:
            project_id, agent_id = parts
            if project_id in self.sessions and agent_id in self.sessions[project_id]:
                return self.sessions[project_id][agent_id]
    
    # Fallback: search all projects
    for project_id, agents in self.sessions.items():
        if agent_identifier in agents:
            return agents[agent_identifier]
    
    return None
```

### Project-Scoped Storage
- Agents are now stored as: `self.sessions[project_id][agent_id] = session`
- Each agent session includes metadata with:
  - `project_id`: The project it belongs to
  - `fqn`: Full qualified name (e.g., "test-project.test-assistant")
  - `instance_id`: The agent's instance ID
  - `agent_type`: The template type used

### Agent States Response
- `get_agent_states()` now returns FQNs as keys
- Each state includes `project_id` and `fqn` fields
- List agents properly filters by project

## Benefits

1. **Proper Isolation**: Agents are now properly scoped to projects
2. **No Name Conflicts**: Same agent ID can exist in different projects
3. **Better Organization**: Clear project-agent relationships
4. **FQN Support**: Can reference agents by full path (project.agent)
5. **Terminate Works**: Fixed parameter mismatch allows proper cleanup

## Testing Notes

The Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks framework is ready to test these changes:
- Test harness already passes project ID when spawning
- Agents will now be created as `test-project.test-assistant` instead of global
- Terminate command should work properly
- No more "agent already exists" errors across projects

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation with Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks
2. Verify agents are properly scoped to projects
3. Confirm terminate command works
4. Check that agent listing filters by project correctly
