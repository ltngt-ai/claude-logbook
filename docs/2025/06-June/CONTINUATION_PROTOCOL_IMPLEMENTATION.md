# Continuation Protocol Implementation

## Date: 2025-06-08

### Overview
Implemented task-level continuation protocol handling in MindSwarm to support multi-phase task execution with CONTINUE/TERMINATE signals.

### Problem
Agents were using the continuation protocol correctly in their responses but the system wasn't processing these signals to continue task execution. This resulted in agents completing only the first phase of multi-phase tasks.

### Solution

#### 1. Fixed Continuation Detection in agent_manager.py
Added comprehensive continuation detection logic that handles both structured and non-structured model responses:

```python
# Check for continuation protocol
should_continue = False
continuation_reason = ""

# Check if this is a structured response with native continuation field
if isinstance(result, dict) and "continuation" in result:
    # Structured output - continuation is a direct field
    continuation = result.get("continuation", {})
    if isinstance(continuation, dict) and continuation.get("status") == "CONTINUE":
        should_continue = True
        continuation_reason = continuation.get("reason", "Continuing task")
        logger.info(f"ðŸ”„ Structured continuation detected: {continuation_reason}")
else:
    # Non-structured output - need to extract from response text
    response_text = result.get("response", "") if isinstance(result, dict) else str(result)
    
    # Check the final channel content for continuation JSON
    final_content = channel_response.get("final", "")
    if final_content:
        # Look for continuation JSON at the end of the final content
        import re
        continuation_match = re.search(r'\{"continuation":\s*\{[^}]+\}\}', final_content)
        if continuation_match:
            try:
                continuation_json = json.loads(continuation_match.group())
                continuation = continuation_json.get("continuation", {})
                if continuation.get("status") == "CONTINUE":
                    should_continue = True
                    continuation_reason = continuation.get("reason", "Continuing task")
                    logger.info(f"ðŸ”„ Non-structured continuation detected: {continuation_reason}")
            except json.JSONDecodeError:
                logger.warning("Failed to parse continuation JSON from response")
```

#### 2. Task Continuation Queueing
When a CONTINUE signal is detected, the system now queues a continuation task:

```python
if should_continue:
    # Queue continuation
    await session.task_queue.put({
        "prompt": f"Continue with the current task. Previous step: {continuation_reason}",
        "context": {
            "parent_task": task_id,
            "continuation": True,
            "previous_reason": continuation_reason
        },
        "type": "continuation"
    })
```

### Testing Results

#### Before Fix:
- Test 004: Agents only completed Phase 1 (created data.txt)
- No continuation was triggered despite agents sending CONTINUE signals

#### After Fix:
- Test 004: Agents now complete Phase 1 and Phase 2 (create data.txt and summary.txt)
- Continuation is properly detected but Phase 3 still not executing
- This suggests the continuation mechanism is working but may need additional debugging

### Remaining Issues

1. **Phase 3 Not Executing**: Even with continuation working for Phase 2, agents aren't reaching Phase 3. This may be due to:
   - Agents sending TERMINATE after Phase 2 instead of CONTINUE
   - Context not being properly maintained between continuations
   - Task queue processing stopping after one continuation

2. **Context Preservation**: Need to ensure the agent maintains awareness of which phase they're in and what phases remain.

### Next Steps

1. Add more detailed logging to track continuation flow
2. Verify agents are sending CONTINUE after Phase 2
3. Check if context is properly preserved between continuations
4. Consider adding phase tracking to the continuation context
