# Task Assignment and Tools Configuration Fix - June 8, 2025

## Overview
Fixed multiple issues in the MindSwarm task assignment system, including mailbox API mismatches, singleton pattern issues, and agent tool configuration.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Mailbox API Mismatch
**Problem**: Server was calling `send_message()` but mailbox only had `send_mail()` method.
**Solution**: Updated server code in `main.py` to use the correct `send_mail()` API.

### 2. Mailbox Singleton Issue  
**Problem**: Server was creating new `MailboxSystem()` instances instead of using the singleton, causing messages to be sent to one instance while agents checked a different instance.
**Solution**: Changed server to import and use `get_mailbox()` singleton function.

### 3. StructuredLogger Missing Method
**Problem**: `StructuredLogger` class was missing the `isEnabledFor()` method that's standard in Python's logging.Logger.
**Solution**: Added the `isEnabledFor()` method to StructuredLogger class that delegates to the underlying logger.

### 4. Agent Tools Configuration
**Problem**: Agents were not getting any tools (0 filtered tools) because agents.yaml referenced non-existent tool sets.
**Solution**: Updated agents.yaml to use actual tool directory names:
- Assistant agent: communication, readonly_filesystem, write_filesystem, code_execution, analysis
- Research agent: communication, readonly_filesystem, analysis, external

### 5. Server Management
**Problem**: No easy way to start/stop/restart the server.
**Solution**: Created `manage_server.sh` script with commands:
- start/stop/restart/status/logs
- Handles virtual environment activation
- Manages PID file for clean shutdown
- Provides colored output for better UX

## Code Changes

### Files Modified:
1. `src/mindswarm/server/main.py` - Fixed task assignment to use send_mail()
2. `src/mindswarm/services/agents/agent_manager.py` - Fixed metadata access
3. `src/mindswarm/core/structured_logging.py` - Added isEnabledFor() method
4. `config/agents/agents.yaml` - Updated tool_sets to use real directories
5. `manage_server.sh` - New server management script

### Key Code Snippets:

Task assignment fix:
```python
# Get the global mailbox instance
from mindswarm.core.communication.mailbox import get_mailbox
mailbox = get_mailbox()

# Create mail message
mail = Mail(
    from_agent="system",
    to_agent=agent_id,
    subject=f"Task Assignment: {task_id}",
    body=task_message,
    priority=MessagePriority.HIGH,
    metadata={"channel": "task"}
)

mailbox.send_mail(mail)
```

## Testing Results
- Task assignment now works correctly
- Agents receive task messages through mailbox
- Agents process tasks (though still investigating tool loading issue)
- No more StructuredLogger errors

## Next Steps
1. Investigate why agents still report "0 filtered tools" despite correct configuration
2. Run SimpleTasks tests to validate full functionality
3. Clean up communication folder structure (lower priority)

## Lessons Learned
1. Always use singleton pattern consistently - mixing singleton and instance creation causes subtle bugs
2. When refactoring APIs, search for all usages to ensure consistency
3. Tool configuration needs to match actual directory structure
4. Server management scripts greatly improve developer experience
