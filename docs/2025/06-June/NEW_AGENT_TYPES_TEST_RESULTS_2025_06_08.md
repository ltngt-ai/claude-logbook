# New Agent Types Test Results
**Date**: June 8, 2025

## Summary
Successfully added 4 new agent types to Mind-Swarm and tested them with SimpleTasks framework.

## New Agent Types Created

1. **Willy the Watcher (w)** - Monitors and reports on activities
2. **Patricia the Project Manager (p)** - Manages projects and coordinates task managers  
3. **Tracey the Task Manager (t)** - Manages individual tasks and coordinates agents
4. **Stephen the Software Engineer (s)** - Expert coder and software engineer

## Test Configuration Updates

### Test 001 (README Creation)
- Updated to include all agents with `write_filesystem` capability: a, p, t, s
- Excluded research (r) and watcher (w) as they only have readonly access

### Test 002 (Python Calendar App)
- Limited to assistant (a) and software engineer (s) only
- These are the agents expected to write code

## Test Results

### Initial Run (Before Server Restart)
- All new agent types failed to spawn with error: "No agent template found"
- Server needed restart to load new configurations

### After Server Restart
- ✅ All agent types now spawn successfully
- ✅ Server recognizes all 6 agent types (a, r, w, p, t, s)

### Test Performance

**Test 001 - README Creation:**
- ✅ Assistant (a) - PASSED (created README.md)
- ❌ Project Manager (p) - FAILED (no file created)
- ❌ Task Manager (t) - FAILED (no file created)
- ❌ Software Engineer (s) - FAILED (no file created)

**Test 002 - Python Calendar App:**
- ✅ Assistant (a) - PASSED (created calendar_app.py)
- ❌ Software Engineer (s) - FAILED (no file created)

## Analysis

1. **Infrastructure Success**: The agent system correctly loads and spawns all new agent types
2. **Behavioral Gap**: New agents with minimal prompts don't execute file creation tasks
3. **Expected Outcome**: This is normal for agents with simple prompts - they need more specific instructions and examples

## Known Issues

1. Non-critical error: `'ProjectManager' object has no attribute '_create_whisper_structure'`
   - Appears during project creation but doesn't prevent operation
   - Needs investigation but not blocking

## Next Steps

The framework is working correctly. To make new agents functional:
1. Enhance agent prompts with specific examples and behaviors
2. Add task-specific instructions for each agent type
3. Consider adding few-shot examples to prompts
4. Gradually refine based on test results

## Conclusion

Successfully established infrastructure for 6 different agent types. The test framework correctly identifies which agents are performing tasks and which aren't. This provides a solid foundation for iterative improvement of agent capabilities.
