# Backend API Test Fixes Progress

## Date: 2025-06-10

### Summary
Successfully fixed test failures in both the execution service and response enhancer service tests by addressing several issues with the implementation and test expectations.

### Issues Fixed

1. **TaskStatus Literal Values**
   - Changed from enum-style `TaskStatus.CREATED` to string literals `"created"`
   - Updated all status references throughout execution_service.py
   - Fixed tests to use lowercase string values

2. **Task Model Fields**
   - Fixed `task.id` â†’ `task.task_id` references
   - Removed references to non-existent `task.type` field
   - Removed references to non-existent `task.name` field

3. **Force Start Parameter**
   - Added `force_start` as a separate parameter to `start_execution` method
   - Updated test to pass `force_start=True` instead of trying to set it on ExecutionOptions

4. **Agent Manager Integration**
   - Fixed agent lookup to use `_resolve_agent_session` instead of non-existent `get_agent` method
   - Updated all agent references to use session objects
   - Changed `list_agents()` to `get_agent_states()` for agent enumeration

5. **Agent State**
   - Removed reference to non-existent `AgentState.ERROR`
   - Fixed agent suitability checks to work with session objects

6. **Mock Setup**
   - Added missing `update_task_status` mock to task service
   - Updated agent mocks to use session structure

7. **Double Decrement Fix**
   - Fixed agent load being decremented twice in cancel flow
   - Load is now only decremented in `_finalize_execution`

8. **ExecutionHistory Validation**
   - Added required `completed_at` and `duration_ms` fields to test data

### Test Results
- All 22 execution service tests now passing
- Comprehensive coverage of:
  - Task execution start/stop/pause/resume
  - Agent selection and scoring
  - Execution queue management
  - Metrics and history tracking
  - Resource management

### Response Enhancer Service Fixes

1. **Mock Configuration Issues**
   - Fixed Mock objects returning Mock instances instead of strings
   - Properly set attributes on Mock objects for workspace_id and name

2. **Invalid Task Status**
   - Changed "in_progress" to "running" to match TaskStatus literal

3. **Time Calculation Fix**
   - Fixed invalid datetime.replace() with seconds > 59
   - Used timedelta for proper time calculations

4. **Agent Model Issues**
   - Added hasattr check for agent.project_id since Agent model doesn't have this field
   - Updated tests to expect None values when agent lacks project_id

### Test Results
- Execution Service: All 22 tests passing
- Response Enhancer Service: All 11 tests passing
- Total tests fixed: 33

### Impact
Both the execution service and response enhancer service are now fully functional with proper test coverage, enabling the advanced task execution and UI metadata features in the backend API enhancement.
