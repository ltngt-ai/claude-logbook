# Git Cleanup Complete - June 8, 2025

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up all branches and worktrees after merging PR #22.

## Cleanup Actions

### Local Branches Deleted
- `dependabot-fix-worktree`
- `feature/backend-api-enhancement` 
- `pr-22`
- `pr-22-latest`
- `pr-22-local` (deleted earlier)

### Remote Branches Deleted
- `origin/feature/backend-api-enhancement`

### Worktrees Removed
- `/home/deano/projects/mindswarm-core-backend-api` (force removed due to untracked files)

## Final State
```
$ git branch -a
* main
  remotes/origin/main
  remotes/public/main

$ git worktree list
/home/deano/projects/mindswarm-core-private  6d01747 [main]
```

## Repository Status
- Only `main` branch remains locally
- Clean working tree
- No stale remote tracking branches
- No orphaned worktrees
- Repository is in a pristine state ready for new development

## Notes
The worktree had some untracked test files that were old drafts:
- tests/api/test_workspace_api.py
- tests/test_agent_api.py
- tests/test_workspace_api.py

These were not needed as the actual test files were properly integrated in the main PR.
