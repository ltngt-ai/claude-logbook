# Mind-Swarm UI Architecture Implementation - June 9, 2025

## Session Start: 2025-06-09T14:30:00Z

### Context
- Completed comprehensive UI architecture design and backend API enhancement specification
- Need to set up implementation workflow using TDD methodology
- Team member currently using main mindswarm-core-private folder - must use worktrees
- Converting from Claude.md to GitHub Copilot workflow

### Completed Today
1. **Architecture Documentation**
   - `MODERN_UI_ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete UI design with backend analysis
   - `BACKEND_API_ENHANCEMENT_SPEC.md` - Detailed API improvements needed
   - `UI_IMPLEMENTATION_NEXT_STEPS.md` - Implementation roadmap

2. **Repository Setup**
   - Archived obsolete UI: `mindswarm-ui-private` â†’ `mindswarm-ui-private-ARCHIVED-20250609`
   - Created GitHub Copilot equivalent documentation
   - Established logbook structure for context continuity

### Next Steps
1. **Worktree Setup**
   - Create backend API enhancement worktree from main branch
   - Create frontend implementation worktree 
   - Set up parallel development workflow

2. **TDD Implementation**
   - Start with backend API tests (red phase)
   - Implement minimal API endpoints (green phase)
   - Refactor for quality and performance

3. **Priority Implementation Order**
   - Workspace management APIs
   - Agent lifecycle APIs  
   - Task management APIs
   - Git integration APIs
   - Event streaming system
   - Frontend UI components

### Technical Decisions
- Using worktrees to avoid disrupting team member's work
- API-first development approach for frontend/backend coordination
- Event-driven architecture for real-time UI updates
- Workspace-centric UI design pattern

### Code Status
- Research repo: All designs committed and clean
- Core backend: On feature/git-integration branch (team member active)
- CLI frontend: Analyzed for existing patterns
- UI backend: Ready for enhancement implementation

## Implementation Log

### 14:35 - Setting up development workflow

**Worktree Setup Complete:**
- Created `mindswarm-core-backend-api` worktree from main branch
- Restored team member's `feature/git-integration` branch in original repo
- Created new `mindswarm-ui-modern` repository for frontend

**TDD Phase 1 - RED: Writing Failing Tests**
- Created `tests/api/test_workspace_api.py` with comprehensive workspace API tests
- Tests define the complete workspace management behavior:
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
  - Validation and error handling
  - Workspace-project relationships
  - Settings and metadata support
  
**Current Status:** RED phase - tests will fail as API endpoints don't exist yet

**Next Steps:**
1. Run tests to confirm they fail (RED)
2. Create minimal FastAPI app structure (GREEN)
3. Implement workspace API endpoints to pass tests (GREEN)
4. Refactor for code quality and performance (REFACTOR)

### 14:45 - Beginning GREEN phase implementation
