# Git Tools Testing and Fixes

## Date: 2025-06-08

### Summary
Ran tests after Git integration changes and fixed import issues across the codebase.

### Issues Found and Fixed

1. **GitRepositoryError vs GitError**
   - Git tools were importing `GitRepositoryError` but the actual class is `GitError`
   - Fixed by aliasing: `from mindswarm.integrations.git.exceptions import GitError as GitRepositoryError`
   - Updated all Git tools and tests to use this pattern

2. **Test Mocking Issues**
   - Tests were using `spec=GitRepository` which was too restrictive
   - Removed spec to allow proper mocking of all methods
   - Added missing mock attributes for methods that shouldn't be called

3. **Git Hooks Directory**
   - Git integration was trying to create hooks in non-existent .git directory
   - Fixed test by creating necessary directories before running tests

### Tool Pattern Inconsistency Discovered

Found that Mind-Swarm has inconsistent tool implementations:

1. **Existing Git tools** (git_status.py, git_init.py):
   - Import from `mindswarm.tools.base import Tool, ToolResult`
   - Use ToolSchema from `mindswarm.schemas.tool_schemas`
   - These imports don't actually exist in those locations

2. **New Git tools** (git_add.py, git_commit.py, etc.):
   - Import from `mindswarm.tools.base import Tool, ToolExecutionContext`
   - Use ToolSchema in a different way
   - Also non-existent imports

3. **Actual base class**:
   - `BaseTool` in `mindswarm.tools.base_tool`
   - Different interface than what Git tools expect

### Test Results

- ✅ Git integration tests: All 14 tests passing
- ✅ ProjectManager tests: All 17 tests passing
- ❌ Git tool unit tests: Cannot run due to import issues

### Next Steps

Need to resolve tool implementation pattern:
1. Determine correct tool base class structure
2. Update all Git tools to use consistent pattern
3. Either create missing classes or update imports
4. Ensure all tools follow Mind-Swarm conventions

The Git integration with ProjectManager is working correctly, but the individual Git tools need to be aligned with the actual Mind-Swarm tool architecture.
