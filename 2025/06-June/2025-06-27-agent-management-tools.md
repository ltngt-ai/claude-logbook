# 2025-06-27: Agent Management Tools Migration

## Summary
Successfully migrated 5 agent management tools to the new YAML/Python structure in mindswarm-runtime.

## Tools Migrated

### 1. create_agent
- **Purpose**: Create new agents within the MindSwarm system
- **Key Features**:
  - Auto-generates instance IDs if not provided
  - Supports starter packs for initial knowledge
  - Automatically adds agents to task teams when created by task managers
  - Uses RFC 2822 email addresses as identifiers
  - Creates agents with background processors (mail checking)

### 2. list_agents
- **Purpose**: List all agents in a project with filtering
- **Key Features**:
  - Filter by agent type
  - Include/exclude inactive agents (STOPPED, FAILED, TERMINATED, EVICTED)
  - Shows agent state, unread mail status, error count
  - Returns newest agents first

### 3. terminate_agent
- **Purpose**: Terminate other agents gracefully or forcefully
- **Key Features**:
  - Prevents self-termination (must use agent_sleep)
  - Supports graceful vs forceful termination
  - Requires reason for audit trail
  - Accepts multiple ID formats (email, instance ID, legacy format)

### 4. get_agent_status
- **Purpose**: Get detailed status information about a specific agent
- **Key Features**:
  - Shows current state (IDLE, PROCESSING, etc.)
  - Activity timestamps (created_at, last_active)
  - Error count and health indicators
  - Unread mail status
  - Additional metadata

### 5. list_agent_types
- **Purpose**: Discover available agent types that can be created
- **Key Features**:
  - Filter by capabilities category:
    - code_writing (write_filesystem, git)
    - code_analysis (analysis, readonly_filesystem)
    - testing (test_writing, code_execution)
    - documentation (write_filesystem, analysis)
    - project_management (task, scheduling)
    - team_coordination (team, task)
    - research (web_tools, analysis)
    - general_work (basic filesystem)
  - Exclude system agents by default
  - Shows agent capabilities (tool sets)

## Technical Details

### YAML Structure
Each tool has comprehensive YAML metadata including:
- Parameters schema with validation
- Output schema documentation
- AI prompts with usage instructions
- Multiple examples with expected outputs
- Tips for effective usage
- Version and authorship metadata

### Implementation Patterns
- All tools use BaseTool (with integrated YAML support)
- Consistent error handling with try-catch blocks
- Parameter extraction using _extract_arguments helper
- Context validation before operations
- Proper logging at appropriate levels
- RFC 2822 email format for all agent references

### Key Decisions
1. **Email as Primary ID**: All agent references use RFC 2822 format
2. **No Direct Agent Manager Access**: Tools use get_agent_manager() function
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Operations fail gracefully with clear error messages
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: All inputs validated before operations
