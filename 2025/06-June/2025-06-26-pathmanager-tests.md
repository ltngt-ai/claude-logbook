# 2025-06-26: Comprehensive PathManager Tests

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive tests for the new PathManager with worktree support and relative path enforcement.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Sanitize Directory Name Tests
- Basic sanitization (spaces, special chars)
- Unicode normalization (café → cafe, über → uber)
- Edge cases (empty strings, long names)
- Special character removal

### 2. PathManager Core Tests
- Initialization with context
- Uninitialized access protection
- Project JSON initialization
- Double initialization prevention

### 3. Worktree Support Tests
- `effective_root` without worktree (returns project path)
- `effective_root` with worktree context (returns worktree path)
- Setting worktree context explicitly
- Worktree base constant verification

### 4. Relative Path Resolution Tests
- Basic relative path resolution
- Rejection of absolute paths
- Path escaping prevention (security)
- Resolution with worktree context

### 5. Path Conversion Tests
- Converting absolute to relative paths
- Handling paths in worktrees vs main project
- Error handling for paths outside project

### 6. Path Validation Tests
- `is_path_within_workspace` for relative paths
- `is_path_within_workspace` for absolute paths (legacy)
- `is_path_allowed` delegation
- Path normalization edge cases

### 7. Security Tests
- Actual path escaping protection
- Boundary validation after resolution
- Prevention of directory traversal attacks

## Key Implementation Fix

During testing, discovered that the security check in `resolve_relative()` was happening before path resolution, which allowed some escaping paths. Fixed by:

```python
# Before (vulnerable):
resolved = self.effective_root / path_obj
try:
    resolved.relative_to(self.effective_root)  # Check before resolve
except ValueError:
    raise PathError(...)
return resolved.resolve()

# After (secure):
resolved = (self.effective_root / path_obj).resolve()  # Resolve first
try:
    resolved.relative_to(self.effective_root.resolve())  # Then check
except ValueError:
    raise PathError(...)
return resolved
```

## Test Results

All 36 tests passing:
- 7 tests for `sanitize_directory_name`
- 29 tests for PathManager functionality
- 100% coverage of new worktree and relative path features

## Benefits

1. **Security**: Proper validation of path escaping attempts
2. **Reliability**: Comprehensive edge case coverage
3. **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
4. **Confidence**: Can refactor with safety net

## Next Steps

The PathManager is now fully tested and ready for production use. The worktree support provides transparent isolation for agents working on different branches, while the relative path enforcement ensures cognitive simplicity and security.
