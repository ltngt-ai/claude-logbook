# MindSwarm Runtime Migration - Day 2
Date: 2025-06-27

## Session 2: Agent Management Tools Migration

### Progress Summary
Successfully migrated all 5 agent management tools to the new runtime structure:
1. create_agent - Creates new agents with auto-ID generation and task team integration
2. list_agents - Lists agents with filtering by state and type
3. terminate_agent - Terminates agents with self-termination prevention
4. get_agent_status - Gets detailed agent status information
5. list_agent_types - Lists available agent types by capability category

### Key Findings

#### Dependency Chain Issues
Discovered that agent tools have a complex dependency chain:
```
agent tools → agent_manager → agent → ai_loop → ai_providers → exceptions
```

This means even tools that don't directly use AI services (like list_agents) still can't be tested until the AI service migration is complete.

#### Architecture Insight
User correctly identified that AI provider-specific exceptions (ClaudeMaxAIServiceError, etc.) should be in the runtime implementations, not in core. This is part of the runtime/engine separation principle.

### Test Status
- Created comprehensive test suites for all 5 agent tools (67 tests total)
- All tests are currently skipped with: `pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip(reason="Waiting for agent services migration to runtime repo")`
- Tests will be enabled after AI services are migrated to runtime

### Migration Stats
- Total tools migrated: 9/83 (11%)
- Priority 1 Communication: 4/4 ✓ (100% tested and passing)
- Priority 1 Agent Management: 5/5 ✓ (awaiting AI service migration for tests)
- Priority 1 Filesystem: 0/4 (next up)

### Next Steps
1. Continue with Priority 1 Basic Filesystem Tools:
   - read_file
   - write_file
   - list_directory
   - delete_file

2. These should have no AI service dependencies and can be fully tested

### Technical Notes
- YAML metadata loading is working perfectly
- Tool parameter validation is comprehensive
- Error handling follows consistent patterns
- All tools use RFC 2822 email format for agent identifiers

## Session 3: AI Provider Architecture Clarification

### Key Decision
After discussion about where AI providers belong:
- AI provider YAML configurations go in runtime (`ai_providers/` directory)
- AI provider Python implementations remain in core (for now)
- This creates a dependency issue for testing agent tools

### Work Completed
1. Created AI provider infrastructure in runtime:
   - `ai_providers/schema.yaml` - Schema definition for provider configs
   - `ai_providers/openrouter.yaml` - OpenRouter provider configuration
   - Started test infrastructure for providers

2. Attempted to create mocks for agent_manager to enable testing
   - This proved complex due to deep dependency chains
   - Decided to keep tests skipped for now

### Architecture Insights
The runtime repository structure is becoming clearer:
- YAML configurations for dynamic data (agents, tools, AI providers)
- Python implementations for tools (in runtime)
- Core services and infrastructure remain in core
- Need to resolve where AI provider implementations should live

### Current Blockers
- Agent tool tests cannot run due to dependency on core's agent_manager
- agent_manager depends on AI services which have import issues
- Need to either:
  1. Mock the entire dependency chain
  2. Move AI services to runtime
  3. Fix the import issues in core

### Recommendation
Focus on filesystem tools next as they should have no AI service dependencies and can be fully tested, providing a working example of the complete tool migration pattern.
