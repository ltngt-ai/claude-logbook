# Mind-Swarm Migration Complete - Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated from AIWhisperer monorepo to Mind-Swarm multi-repo architecture under the @ltngt-ai organization.

## Repositories Created

### Private Development Repos
1. **mindswarm-core-private** - Backend engine with full async agent capabilities
2. **mindswarm-ui-private** - Frontend monorepo with pnpm workspaces
3. **mindswarm-pro** - Premium UI features (always private)
4. **mindswarm-docs** - Documentation site with MkDocs
5. **mindswarm-website** - Marketing site for ltngt.ai
6. **mindswarm-common** - Shared utilities and types
7. **claude-logbook** - AI agent working notes and daily logs

### Public OSS Repos
1. **mindswarm-core** - Public version synced monthly from private
2. **mindswarm-ui** - Public version synced monthly from private

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Repository Extraction
- Used git subtree to preserve full commit history
- Reorganized code structure for cleaner architecture
- Added modern Python packaging with pyproject.toml
- Set up pnpm monorepo for frontend

### 2. Public Release System
- Created sync_to_public.sh script for monthly releases
- Successfully synced first public release (v2025-06)
- Both public repos are now live with full source code
- No artificial limitations in OSS version

### 3. CI/CD Infrastructure
- **Python (Core)**: Multi-version testing, security scanning, PyPI releases
- **Node (UI)**: pnpm support, E2E testing, type checking
- **Docs**: Auto-deploy to GitHub Pages
- **Automation**: Monthly sync workflow, Dependabot updates

### 4. AIWhisperer Cleanup
- Organized 67 test files into proper test/ directory structure
- Archived development documentation and logs
- Cleaned up root directory to only essential files
- Ready for archival once confirmed stable

## Technical Decisions

### Architecture
- **OSS First**: Full functionality in open source version
- **Pro = Premium UX**: Better tools and UI, not limited features
- **Git History**: Preserved using git subtree split
- **Modern Tooling**: pyproject.toml, pnpm workspaces, GitHub Actions

### Security
- All repositories use HTTPS (not SSH) for compatibility
- GitHub Actions secrets for automated releases
- Proper .gitignore and security scanning in CI

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Configure branch protection rules on all repos
2. Set up GitHub Pages for documentation
3. Create initial releases with proper versioning

### Short Term
1. Archive AIWhisperer repository
2. Set up ltngt.ai domain and website
3. Create community guidelines and contributing docs
4. Announce public launch

### Long Term
1. Build community around open source project
2. Develop premium features for mindswarm-pro
3. Regular monthly public releases
4. Expand documentation and tutorials

## Lessons Learned
1. Git subtree is excellent for preserving history during splits
2. Automation scripts save significant time and reduce errors
3. Clear separation of OSS vs Pro features from the start
4. Comprehensive CI/CD setup early prevents technical debt
