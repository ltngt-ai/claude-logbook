# MindSwarm Bug Fixes: Agent Context and Tool Async Methods
Date: 2025-06-11

## Summary
Fixed two GitHub issues in mindswarm-core-private:
- Issue #32: send_mail shows from=Unknown
- Issue #33: Various tool errors when loaded from tool_registry

## Issue #32: Agent Context Not Passed to Tools

### Problem
The send_mail tool was showing "from=Unknown" in logs because the agent context (agent_id, agent_name) wasn't being passed to tools during execution.

### Solution
Modified `ai_loop.py` in the `_execute_tool_calls` method to properly pass agent context:
```python
# Add agent context to tool args
enriched_args = tool_args.copy()
if self.agent_context:
    # Pass the actual agent information
    enriched_args['_agent_id'] = self.agent_context.get('agent_id')
    enriched_args['_agent_name'] = self.agent_context.get('agent_name')
    enriched_args['_from_agent'] = self.agent_context.get('agent_name', self.agent_context.get('agent_id'))
```

The agent context is set when the AI loop is created in `AILoopManager.get_or_create_ai_loop()`.

## Issue #33: Developer Tools Missing execute_async

### Problem
Five developer tools were failing to load with error:
```
Can't instantiate abstract class XXXTool without an implementation for abstract method 'execute_async'
```

### Affected Tools
1. MonitoringControlTool
2. SessionInspectorTool
3. MessageInjectorTool
4. WorkspaceValidatorTool
5. PromptMetricsTool

### Solution
Updated all tools to implement `execute_async(**kwargs)` instead of `execute()`:
1. Changed method signature to `async def execute_async(self, **kwargs) -> Dict[str, Any]:`
2. Added parameter extraction logic to handle both direct kwargs and wrapped 'arguments' pattern
3. Updated return values to return dicts as expected by BaseTool interface

## Code Refactoring

Based on Copilot's suggestion, refactored the repetitive parameter extraction logic:

1. Added `_extract_arguments()` helper method to BaseTool:
```python
def _extract_arguments(self, kwargs: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Helper method to extract actual arguments from kwargs."""
    if 'arguments' in kwargs and isinstance(kwargs['arguments'], dict):
        return kwargs['arguments']
    else:
        return kwargs
```

2. Updated all 5 developer tools to use the common helper method instead of duplicating the logic

## Testing

Created test scripts to verify:
- Agent context is properly passed and received by send_mail tool
- All developer tools now implement execute_async correctly
- send_mail shows correct agent name instead of 'Unknown'

## PR Details
- Branch: `fix/agent-context-and-tool-async`
- PR #37: https://github.com/ltngt-ai/mindswarm-core-private/pull/37
- Both issues closed with references to the PR
- PR merged successfully

## Cleanup
- Deleted local feature branch
- Pruned remote tracking branches
- Cleaned up old local branches (feature/agent-naming-system, feature/cli-assistant-chat, fix-datetime-serialization, fix/agent-terminology-cleanup)

## Key Learnings
1. The AI loop passes agent context to tools through enriched arguments
2. All tools must implement execute_async per the BaseTool interface
3. Tools need to handle both direct kwargs and wrapped 'arguments' pattern
4. Common patterns should be extracted to base classes to avoid duplication
