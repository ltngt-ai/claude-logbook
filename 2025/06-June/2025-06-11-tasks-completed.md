# 2025-06-11: Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks Tasks Completed

## Summary
Completed all pending tasks for Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks and GitHub issues #38 and #46.

## Tasks Completed

### 1. Updated Test Harness to Use CLI (Issue #46)
- Replaced direct API calls with `mindswarm project create` CLI command
- The CLI now properly supports workspace selection via `--workspace` option
- Uses active workspace by default if not specified
- This allows the test harness to work without direct API access

### 2. Renamed Local Folder to Snake Case
- Renamed `Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks` to `mindswarm_simple_tasks`
- This follows Python naming conventions
- Addresses part of GitHub issue #38

## Notes
- The existing GitHub repo remains as Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks (CamelCase)
- Creating a new snake_case repo was marked as low priority
- User confirmed the only remaining task was renaming the local folder
- All changes have been committed and pushed to the existing repo

## Repository Status
All Mind-Swarm repositories are now properly organized:
- mindswarm-core-private
- mindswarm-cli-private  
- mindswarm-ui-private
- mindswarm_simple_tasks (local folder, GitHub repo still CamelCase)

The project is in a clean state with all requested changes completed.
