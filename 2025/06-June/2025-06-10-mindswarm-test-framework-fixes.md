# 2025-06-10: MindSwarm Test Framework Fixes

## Issues Identified

Running the MindSwarmSimpleTasks test suite revealed several critical issues with the new agent-first architecture:

### 1. Project Creation Without PathManager
- **Issue**: Projects are created successfully but error with "Project not found or has no PathManager"
- **Impact**: Agents cannot be created in projects because PathManager isn't initialized
- **Root Cause**: The project creation flow doesn't properly initialize the PathManager for new projects

### 2. Agent Registration Failure
- **Issue**: Agents are created but not registered in the agent registry
- **Impact**: Task assignment fails with "Unknown recipient: 'test-assistant'. Agent not found in registry"
- **Root Cause**: The agent creation flow doesn't register the agent in the agent registry

### 3. CLI Command Updates
- **Fixed**: Updated demo.sh to use `agent create` instead of deprecated `agent spawn`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 4. Test False Positives
- **Issue**: Tests report success even when no files are created
- **Cause**: Old test results from June 8th are being evaluated instead of new results
- **Impact**: Misleading test results

## Key Observations

### Agent-First Architecture Working
Despite the issues, the core architecture is sound:
- Projects are created with unique IDs
- Tasks are created successfully
- The mail-based task assignment system is implemented
- The flow would work if agents were properly registered

### Test Harness Working
The test harness itself is functional:
- Correctly identifies workspace
- Creates projects via API
- Attempts agent creation and task assignment
- Properly evaluates results (when they exist)

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Agent Registration
The agent creation process needs to:
1. Create the agent instance
2. Register it in the agent registry with proper aliases
3. Ensure it's findable by instance_id for task assignment

### Priority 2: Fix Project PathManager
Projects need proper initialization:
1. Create project with workspace_id
2. Initialize PathManager for the project
3. Ensure agents can access project paths

### Priority 3: Clean Test Results
- Clear old test results before running new tests
- Ensure only current test run results are evaluated

## Technical Details

### Current Flow
```
1. Create Project → Success (but no PathManager)
2. Create Agent → Partial Success (created but not registered)
3. Create Task → Success
4. Assign Task → Failure (agent not in registry)
```

### Expected Flow
```
1. Create Project → Initialize with PathManager
2. Create Agent → Create instance + Register in agent registry
3. Create Task → Success
4. Assign Task → Find agent in registry → Send mail → Success
```
