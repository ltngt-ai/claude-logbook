# GitHub API Integration Plan - 2025-06-08

## Overview
GitHub API integration will be our first major workflow feature, allowing Mind-Swarm agents to interact with GitHub repositories for code management, issue tracking, and collaboration.

## Strategic Value
- Real-world workflow automation
- Integration with developer tools
- Foundation for more API integrations
- Demonstrates Mind-Swarm's practical utility

## Core GitHub API Capabilities Needed

### 1. Repository Operations
- Clone/create repositories
- Read repository contents
- Create/update/delete files
- Branch management
- Commit operations

### 2. Issue Management
- List, create, update issues
- Comment on issues
- Label management
- Milestone tracking
- Issue search and filtering

### 3. Pull Request Operations
- Create pull requests
- Review and comment on PRs
- Merge/close pull requests
- PR status checks

### 4. Code Review and Analysis
- Diff analysis
- Code quality checks
- Security scanning
- Dependency analysis

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Basic GitHub Tools (1-2 weeks)
1. **Authentication Setup**
   - GitHub token management
   - OAuth integration for user auth
   - Secure credential storage

2. **Core Repository Tools**
   - `github_clone_repo`
   - `github_read_file`
   - `github_create_file`
   - `github_update_file`
   - `github_list_files`

3. **Issue Management Tools**
   - `github_create_issue`
   - `github_list_issues`
   - `github_update_issue`
   - `github_comment_on_issue`

### Phase 2: Advanced Operations (2-3 weeks)
1. **Pull Request Tools**
   - `github_create_pr`
   - `github_review_pr`
   - `github_merge_pr`

2. **Branch Management**
   - `github_create_branch`
   - `github_switch_branch`
   - `github_compare_branches`

3. **Code Analysis Tools**
   - `github_analyze_diff`
   - `github_search_code`
   - `github_get_commits`

### Phase 3: Workflow Automation (3-4 weeks)
1. **Automated Workflows**
   - Code review automation
   - Issue triaging
   - Release management
   - Documentation updates

2. **Integration Tools**
   - CI/CD integration
   - Notification systems
   - Project board management

## Example Use Cases

### 1. Automated Code Review
```
Agent: code-reviewer
Task: "Review the latest PR in repo X, check for security issues, performance problems, and code quality. Create review comments with specific line-by-line feedback."
```

### 2. Issue Management
```
Agent: project-manager
Task: "Triage new issues in repo Y, categorize by priority and type, assign to appropriate team members, and create project board cards."
```

### 3. Documentation Maintenance
```
Agent: documentation-writer
Task: "Update the README and API documentation in repo Z to reflect the recent changes in the codebase. Create a PR with the updates."
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Tool Architecture
- Follow existing Mind-Swarm tool patterns
- Use PyGithub or httpx for API calls
- Implement proper error handling and rate limiting
- Support both organization and personal repos

### Security Considerations
- Secure token storage in agent context
- Repository access controls
- Audit logging for all operations
- Permission validation

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all tools
- Integration tests with test repositories
- Agent workflow tests
- Performance and rate limit testing

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Agents can successfully perform basic GitHub operations
- ✅ Complex multi-step workflows work reliably
- ✅ Integration with existing Mind-Swarm features
- ✅ Positive user feedback on workflow automation

## Next Steps
1. Create GitHub issue for tracking implementation
2. Design tool interface specifications
3. Set up test repositories for development
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation

This GitHub integration will establish Mind-Swarm as a practical tool for real developer workflows and serve as a template for future API integrations.
