# Event Subscription System Implementation Complete - June 9, 2025

## Summary
Successfully implemented Phase 1 event subscription management APIs, enabling real-time event streaming and historical event queries for the Mind-Swarm frontend.

## APIs Implemented

### 1. Subscribe to Events (`mindswarm.events.subscribe`)
- Create/update event subscriptions
- Filter by workspace, project, agent, task, severity
- Support for wildcard patterns (e.g., "task.*")
- Optional historical events on subscription
- WebSocket-based real-time delivery

### 2. Unsubscribe (`mindswarm.events.unsubscribe`)
- Remove subscriptions by ID
- Automatic cleanup of WebSocket connections

### 3. List Subscriptions (`mindswarm.events.listSubscriptions`)
- View all active subscriptions
- Shows events received count and last event time

### 4. Get Event History (`mindswarm.events.getHistory`)
- Query historical events with filters
- Time range support (since/until)
- Pagination for large result sets
- Returns oldest/newest event timestamps

## Event System Architecture

### Event Models
1. **EnhancedEvent**
   - Unique event_id and timestamp
   - Event type with dot notation (e.g., "task.created")
   - Source: agent/user/system/git
   - Context with resource IDs and names
   - Metadata with severity and suggested actions
   - Human-readable description

2. **EventSubscription**
   - Subscription tracking with filters
   - Connection management for WebSocket
   - Event statistics (count, last event)

### EventService Implementation
- In-memory event history (configurable size)
- Subscription matching with wildcards
- WebSocket connection management
- Automatic connection cleanup on disconnect
- Thread-safe with async locks

### Event Types Supported
- `workspace.*` - created, updated, deleted, switched
- `project.*` - created, updated, deleted, archived
- `task.*` - created, assigned, started, progress, completed, failed
- `agent.*` - created, started, sleeping, woken, deleted
- `git.*` - commit, push, conflict, merge
- `system.*` - error, warning, info

## Integration Points
- WebSocket handler tracks connection IDs
- Event handlers receive connection context
- Automatic event emission on:
  - Workspace creation
  - Project creation
  - Task creation
  - Task assignment
  - (More can be added easily)

## Testing Results
- ✅ WebSocket subscription working
- ✅ Real-time event delivery confirmed
- ✅ Event filtering by type patterns
- ✅ Historical event retrieval
- ✅ Multiple subscriptions supported
- ✅ Connection cleanup on disconnect

## Example Event
```json
{
  "event_id": "e7c4f3a2-...",
  "event_type": "task.created",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-09T20:51:35Z",
  "source": "system",
  "context": {
    "project_id": "76ce8781-...",
    "task_id": "event-test-001"
  },
  "data": {},
  "metadata": {
    "affects": ["event-test-001", "76ce8781-..."],
    "severity": "info",
    "is_actionable": false
  },
  "description": "Task 'Test task for event system...' created"
}
```

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Event Subscription Management - **COMPLETED**
2. ⏳ Add more event emissions throughout the codebase
3. ⏳ Implement event batching for high-frequency events
4. ⏳ Add event persistence for longer history
5. ⏳ Create event-driven automation hooks
