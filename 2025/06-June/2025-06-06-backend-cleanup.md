# Backend Cleanup Log - January 6, 2025

## Objective
Streamline mindswarm-core to focus exclusively on async agent workflows over WebSocket. Remove all legacy code, CLI interfaces, batch processing, and implement proper structured logging.

## Analysis Results

### Core Requirements
The backend should only include:
1. **WebSocket API** - For client communication
2. **Async Agent System** - Core agent orchestration
3. **AI Service Integration** - OpenRouter and tool calling
4. **Essential Tools** - Agent communication and lifecycle
5. **Structured Logging** - Replace file proliferation

### Components to Remove
- Entire CLI interface (`cli/`)
- Conversation replay system
- MCP integration (unless actively used)
- AST/code analysis tools
- Legacy model capabilities
- Batch processing components
- Plan/RFC tools (unless needed)

### Logging System Design
Current issues:
- Hundreds of log files with timestamps
- Different log files for each component
- No rotation or cleanup
- Difficult to debug across components

Proposed solution:
- Single structured JSON logger
- Log to stdout/stderr for container compatibility
- Optional file output with rotation
- Correlation IDs for request tracking
- Log levels: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Set up new logging system
1. Create structured logging module
2. Replace all file-based logging
3. Add correlation ID tracking
4. Configure log rotation if file output needed

### Phase 2: Remove legacy code
1. Delete CLI directory
2. Remove conversation replay
3. Clean up unused tools
4. Remove model capabilities system
5. Delete batch processing code

### Phase 3: Refactor core
1. Simplify configuration
2. Consolidate agent management
3. Clean up dependencies
4. Update tests for new structure

## Progress Update - Phase 1 Complete

### Completed Tasks
1. **Created structured logging system** (`src/mindswarm/core/structured_logging.py`)
   - JSON-formatted logs with correlation IDs
   - Rotating file handler support
   - Proper log levels and library configuration
   - No more hundreds of log files!

2. **Removed legacy code** (28 items)
   - Entire CLI interface removed
   - Conversation replay system removed
   - Legacy model capabilities removed
   - AST/code analysis tools removed
   - Plan/RFC tools removed
   - Old test directories cleaned up

3. **Updated imports** (92 files)
   - Changed all `ai_whisperer` imports to `mindswarm`
   - Fixed duplicate imports issue
   - Updated logging imports to use new structured system

4. **Cleaned up tools directory**
   - Removed duplicate tool versions (_old, _original, _optimized, _lazy)
   - Removed unused tool registration files
   - Kept only essential async agent tools

### Current State
The backend is now much slimmer and focused on:
- WebSocket API for client communication
- Async agent orchestration
- AI service integration (OpenRouter)
- Essential tools for agent lifecycle
- Structured JSON logging

### Issues Fixed
- Circular import in structured_logging.py
- Duplicate imports from cleanup script
- Old logging references updated

### Next Steps
1. Test the server startup with new structure
2. Update configuration to use structured logging âœ“
3. Remove more legacy code if found during testing
4. Update pyproject.toml dependencies

## Issues Found
- CLI command imports still in api/main.py - need to remove or replace with minimal handler
- The dispatch_command_handler still expects CommandRegistry from CLI
- Need to decide: keep slash commands with minimal implementation or remove entirely
