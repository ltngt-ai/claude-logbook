## 2025-06-09 Frontend Layout Fixes

Fixed critical layout issues in the MindSwarm UI:

### Issues Fixed:
1. **Full-screen layout** - Removed restrictive CSS that was preventing proper layout
2. **Icon sizing** - Fixed huge icons by adding proper CSS constraints
3. **Tasks view crash** - Added QueryClient provider for react-query support
4. **Error handling** - Improved error display for missing backend methods

### Layout Structure:
- Left sidebar: Fixed 256px width with navigation
- Main content: Flexible area that fills remaining space
- Proper Tailwind CSS integration with directives
- WebSocket connection with auto-reconnect

The frontend is now ready for parallel development with the backend.
