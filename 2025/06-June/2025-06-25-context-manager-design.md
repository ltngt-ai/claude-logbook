# Context Manager Agent Design
Date: 2025-01-25

## Overview
Designed a comprehensive Context Manager agent system for MindSwarm to handle intelligent context management across all agents. This replaces the simple time/entry-based system with an agent-first approach.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Agent-First Architecture
- Context Manager is a system agent that communicates via mail
- No direct API calls or synchronous operations
- All context operations go through the mail system
- Maintains the ONE Agent Pattern

### 2. Context Management Strategies
Defined five strategies for different agent needs:
- **normal**: Intelligent AI-driven summarization (default)
- **timed**: Simple time-based cleanup
- **entries**: Keep N most recent messages
- **self_managed**: Agent manages its own context
- **custom**: Delegate to another agent

### 3. Pause/Resume Mechanism
- Added PAUSED and RESUMING states to support context operations
- Agents can be paused safely during active processing
- Context Manager coordinates pause/resume via mail
- State preserved and restored correctly

### 4. Configuration Schema
Extended agent YAML with context_management field:
```yaml
context_management:
  strategy: normal
  parameters:
    max_age: 7d
    max_entries: 1000
    compaction_threshold: 0.8
    preserve_recent: 100
  custom_handler: null
```

### 5. Intelligent Summarization
Multi-stage algorithm:
1. Analysis: Extract key information
2. Grouping: Cluster related messages
3. Summarization: Create concise summaries
4. Reconstruction: Build compressed context

### 6. System Integration
- Context Manager starts with system
- Monitors all agents via ContextPolicyService
- Responds to urgent requests immediately
- Maintains registry of agent preferences

## Implementation Plan
Created 8 GitHub issues (#272-#279) covering:
1. Core Context Manager implementation
2. Pause/Resume mechanism
3. Context management tools
4. YAML schema updates
5. ContextPolicyService enhancement
6. Registration system
7. Compaction algorithm
8. Comprehensive test suite

## Design Rationale

### Why Agent-First?
- Consistent with MindSwarm architecture
- Allows async operation without blocking
- Full audit trail via mail
- Enables future distributed operation

### Why Multiple Strategies?
- Different agents have different needs
- Auth agents need minimal context
- Project managers need long memory
- Flexibility for future agent types

### Why Pause/Resume?
- Safe context modification during operation
- Prevents message loss or corruption
- Allows complex multi-step compaction
- Future support for migration/upgrade

## Next Steps
1. Implement Context Manager agent configuration
2. Add pause/resume to AgentManager
3. Create basic compaction algorithm
4. Test with high-volume agents

## Technical Challenges Anticipated
- Ensuring no message loss during compaction
- Maintaining agent state consistency
- Performance of summarization at scale
- Handling concurrent compaction requests

## Future Enhancements
- ML-based summarization models
- Predictive compaction scheduling
- Cross-agent context sharing
- Long-term memory storage
