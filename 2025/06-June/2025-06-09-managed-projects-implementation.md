# Managed Projects Implementation - June 9, 2025

## Overview
Today we implemented the foundation for managed vs unmanaged projects in Mind-Swarm, establishing a clear distinction between AI-orchestrated and user-driven project workflows.

## User's Proposal
The user proposed a sophisticated system where:
- **Managed Projects**: Have AI agents (Project Manager and Task Manager) that autonomously orchestrate work
- **Unmanaged Projects**: Are user-driven with manual task assignment and coordination
- The system should support seamless transitions between managed and unmanaged states
- AI agents in managed projects can create tasks, assign work, and coordinate execution

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Database Model Updates
Added management fields to the Project model:
```python
is_managed: bool = False
project_manager_agent_id: Optional[str] = None
management_config: Optional[Dict] = None
```

### 2. Task Model Creation
Created a comprehensive Task model with:
- Full task lifecycle support (created → assigned → in_progress → completed/failed)
- Integration with managed projects
- Support for both user-created and agent-created tasks
- Rich metadata including priority, deadlines, and effort estimates

### 3. TaskService Implementation
Built a persistent TaskService that:
- Stores tasks in SQLite database
- Provides CRUD operations for tasks
- Supports filtering by project, status, and assignment
- Handles task lifecycle transitions

### 4. Server Integration
Updated the server to:
- Use the new database models
- Integrate TaskService for persistent storage
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing endpoints

### 5. Technical Improvements
- Fixed datetime deprecation warnings by using `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Ensured all datetime objects are timezone-aware
- Improved database schema with proper foreign key relationships

## Design Documentation
Created comprehensive design document at `docs/MANAGED_PROJECTS_DESIGN.md` that covers:
- System architecture and component interactions
- Database schema with ER diagram
- API endpoints for project and task management
- Communication protocols between PM, TM, and Worker agents
- Implementation phases and future enhancements

## Key Concepts

### Managed Projects
- Have dedicated AI agents (PM and TM) that orchestrate work
- PM creates high-level tasks from project goals
- TM breaks down tasks and assigns to workers
- Agents communicate through structured protocols
- System tracks progress and handles failures autonomously

### Unmanaged Projects
- User manually creates and assigns tasks
- Direct control over task prioritization
- No automated orchestration
- Suitable for projects requiring human oversight

## Next Steps
1. **Communication Protocol**: Implement the PM↔TM↔Worker communication system
2. **Execution Engine**: Build the task execution and monitoring system
3. **Agent Templates**: Create PM and TM agent templates with appropriate capabilities
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of the managed project workflow
5. **UI Integration**: Update frontend to support managed project features

## Technical Notes
- The implementation maintains backward compatibility
- Database migrations are handled automatically
- The system is designed for extensibility (e.g., future support for cross-project dependencies)
- Security considerations are built-in (task visibility, agent permissions)

## Reflections
This implementation represents a significant step toward autonomous project management in Mind-Swarm. The clear separation between managed and unmanaged projects provides flexibility while the robust task system ensures reliable execution tracking. The design anticipates future needs while keeping the initial implementation focused and achievable.
