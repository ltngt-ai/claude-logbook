# 2025-06-26: Relative Path Implementation

## Clean Break Implementation

Following up on the worktree architecture design, Deano and I implemented the relative path system with a clean break - no backward compatibility.

## Key Implementation Details

### PathManager Changes
- Added `effective_root` property that automatically returns worktree path if in context
- New `resolve_relative()` method that ONLY accepts relative paths
- Removed all output_path functionality (obsolete isolation attempt)
- Clean, simple API focused on relative paths

### Breaking Changes Made
1. Removed `resolve_file_path()` - no deprecation, just gone
2. All file tools now reject absolute paths immediately
3. Removed output_path from PathManager, Project, and all tools
4. No migration helpers - breaks will surface immediately

### File Tools Updated
- `get_file_content.py` - enforces relative paths
- `write_file.py` - uses project root, not output directory
- `list_directory.py` - returns relative paths
- All tools use consistent path resolution

### Documentation
- Updated all tool YAML configs with warnings about absolute paths
- Clear examples of correct usage
- Emphasis on relative paths in all descriptions

## Benefits of Clean Break

1. **Fast Discovery**: Breaks happen immediately, easy to find and fix
2. **No Confusion**: One way to do things, no legacy code paths
3. **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed obsolete concepts entirely
4. **Better Testing**: Clear expectations, no compatibility layers

## Technical Decisions

- Context awareness built into PathManager constructor
- Worktree resolution happens transparently in `effective_root`
- All path validation still enforced within boundaries
- File tools simplified - just relative in, relative out

## Next Steps

- Write tests for the new PathManager
- Update remaining tools that might use paths
- Monitor for any absolute path usage
- Implement task context inheritance for automatic worktree assignment

This clean implementation sets up the foundation for transparent worktree support where agents just use natural relative paths without any cognitive overhead.
