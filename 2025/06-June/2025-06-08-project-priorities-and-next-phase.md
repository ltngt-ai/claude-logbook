# Mind-Swarm Project Priorities and Next Phase - 2025-06-08

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Major Achievements
- **Core task execution working**: Agents successfully receive tasks, process via AI loops, execute tools, and complete work
- **Test framework operational**: 4 test scenarios running, 586 unit tests passing
- **Tool system established**: Proper security boundaries through PathManager
- **Project management**: Projects can be created with custom IDs and isolation
- **Agent lifecycle**: Complete spawn → task → execute → output workflow functioning

### ❌ Critical Issues Blocking Progress

#### 1. Agent Session Management (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Agents persist globally across projects causing "already exists" errors
- **Impact**: Cannot run tests repeatedly without manual server restart
- **Solution**: Implement project-scoped agent sessions (`project.agent-name` not `global.agent-name`)

#### 2. Agent Termination Bug (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: CLI terminate command fails with "Internal error: 'agent_id'"
- **Impact**: Cannot programmatically clean up agents
- **Solution**: Fix terminate command to handle agent_id parameter properly

#### 3. Legacy Naming Cleanup (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Still using `.WHISPER` folders instead of `.mindswarm`
- **Impact**: Confusing branding, inconsistent UX
- **Solution**: Find/replace throughout codebase

## Strategic Direction Decision

**Chosen Path**: Mixture of Production Readiness (Option A) + Feature Expansion (Option B)

### Key Focus Areas
1. **Agent Capabilities Enhancement**: Make agents more powerful and reliable
2. **Useful Workflows**: Develop practical, real-world agent workflows
3. **Web Frontend with Visibility**: Proper UI for monitoring and control
4. **GitHub Integration**: Issues for tracking + GitHub API as workflow feature

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation Fixes (1-2 weeks)
1. Fix agent session scoping for project isolation
2. Fix terminate command for proper cleanup
3. Complete AIWhisperer→Mind-Swarm migration throughout codebase

### Phase 2: Production + Features (Next 1-2 months)
**Production Readiness Track:**
- Multi-agent collaboration testing and improvement
- Performance optimization and monitoring
- Web frontend integration with proper visibility
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

**Feature Expansion Track:**
- GitHub API integration for workflow automation
- Enhanced agent capabilities and tool ecosystem
- More sophisticated multi-agent workflows
- Advanced task orchestration patterns

### Phase 3: Operational Excellence (Ongoing)
- GitHub issues for proper bug tracking and feature requests
- User documentation and examples
- Community feedback integration
- Continuous capability expansion

## Next Immediate Actions
1. Start with agent session scoping fix
2. Set up GitHub issues for organized tracking
3. Begin planning GitHub API integration as first major workflow feature
4. Design web frontend visibility requirements

## Technical Debt to Address Alongside
- Tool pattern consistency (33 failing tests)
- PathManager refactoring for better testability
- Configuration system completion
- Import cleanup for remaining AIWhisperer references

This represents a clear path from "core functionality working" to "production-ready platform with expanding capabilities" while maintaining focus on real user value.
