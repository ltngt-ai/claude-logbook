# Branch Protection Enabled on Main - June 8, 2025

## Important Change
Branch protection has been enabled on the main branch. All changes must now go through Pull Requests.

## What This Means
1. **No Direct Pushes**: Cannot push directly to main branch
2. **PR Required**: All changes must be made via pull requests
3. **CI Must Pass**: PRs will need to pass all CI checks before merging
4. **Code Review**: PRs can be reviewed before merging

## New Workflow
Going forward, the development workflow will be:
1. Create a feature branch from main
2. Make changes on the feature branch
3. Push the feature branch to origin
4. Create a pull request
5. Wait for CI checks to pass
6. Merge the PR once approved

## Benefits
- **Code Quality**: All changes are reviewed and tested
- **CI Enforcement**: No broken code can reach main
- **History**: Clear record of all changes via PRs
- **Collaboration**: Better visibility of ongoing work

## Example Commands
```bash
# Create new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"

# Push to origin
git push -u origin feature/my-new-feature

# Create PR via GitHub CLI
gh pr create --title "Add new feature" --body "Description of changes"
```

This is a significant improvement to the development process and will help maintain code quality!
