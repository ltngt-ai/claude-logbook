# 2025-06-11: Test Suite Cleanup (Issue #38)

## Summary
Cleaned up Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks test suite and pushed changes to existing GitHub repo. The repo already exists but uses CamelCase naming instead of snake_case.

## Work Done

### Test Suite Reorganization
- Removed tests that required specific models (003-multi-tool-call-chains) or old continuation system (004-natural-workflow)
- Added agent-specific tests:
  - **001b-engineer-file-creation**: Tests software engineer's code implementation
  - **002b-assistant-help**: Tests assistant's interactive help behavior  
  - **003b-research-analysis**: Tests research agent's analysis capabilities

### Key Changes
- Updated test harness to wait 30 seconds instead of 5 (agents need more time)
- Added WORKING_TESTS.md documenting current test status
- Updated agent configurations
- Already had proper .gitignore for test artifacts

### Current Status
- Tests are pushed to https://github.com/ltngt-ai/Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks
- Repo uses CamelCase name instead of snake_case (as requested in issue)
- Tests are now agent-specific rather than expecting all agents to do the same tasks

## Next Steps for Issue #38
- Consider creating new repo with snake_case name: mindswarm_simple_tasks
- Migrate content from current repo
- Archive or redirect old repo

## Issue #46 Notes
Issue #46 mentions that Mind-SwarmSimpleTasks bypasses CLI workspace support. This needs investigation and potentially implementing workspace support in the CLI.
