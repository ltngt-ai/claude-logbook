# 2025-06-11: Managed Projects Feature Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented and merged GitHub issue #47 - Managed Projects and Tasks. This feature enables AI-driven project management where Project Manager and Task Manager agents autonomously manage work.

## Implementation Highlights

### Core Features Delivered
1. **Managed Projects**: Projects with `is_managed=true` flag auto-spawn Project Manager agents
2. **Managed Tasks**: Tasks in managed projects auto-spawn dedicated Task Manager agents
3. **Agent Communication**: Full mailbox integration for task assignments and acknowledgments
4. **CLI Support**: Added `--managed` flag and proper FQN display for agent messaging

### Technical Improvements
- Modernized async patterns: `asyncio.create_task()` instead of `get_event_loop()`
- Fixed `BaseTool.execute()` to use `asyncio.run()` for clean event loop handling
- Enhanced error logging with project/task context
- Fixed all test failures for clean CI

### Working Example
```bash
# Create managed project - auto-spawns PM
mindswarm project create "My AI Project" --managed

# Create task - auto-spawns TM
mindswarm task create "Test with fresh server" --task-id test-task-008

# Task Manager acknowledges and begins work
# Agents coordinate via mailbox system
```

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Async Agent Creation**: Handled background task spawning without blocking
2. **Test Failures**: Fixed prompt_metrics tests failing due to event loop issues
3. **Agent Communication**: Ensured proper FQN resolution for mailbox delivery
4. **CLI Display**: Fixed FQN display and message ID truncation issues

## Pull Request #51
- Feature implementation across core and CLI repositories
- Applied Copilot's code improvement suggestions
- Fixed all test failures for clean merge
- Comprehensive documentation added

## Future Work
Created GitHub issue #52 for self-correction mechanisms to enhance agent autonomy:
- Error detection and recovery
- Task validation and quality checks
- Learning from failures
- Health monitoring
- Checkpoint and recovery

## Status
✅ Feature complete and merged to main
✅ All tests passing
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Future enhancements tracked in issue #52

This establishes a crucial foundation for the agent-first architecture where AI agents can autonomously manage and execute complex projects!
