# Session 4: Tool Migration - June 27, 2025

## Summary
Completed Priority 2 task management and scheduling tools, creating a comprehensive task and scheduling system for Mind-Swarm agents.

## Work Completed

### Priority 2: Task Management Tools
Created 4 task management tools:

1. **create_task** - Creates tasks with Task Manager agents
   - Supports task hierarchy (subtasks)
   - Optional starter packs for domain specialization
   - Automatic Task Manager agent creation
   - Tags, priority, deadline support

2. **update_task_status** - Updates task status and progress
   - Validates status transitions
   - Tracks status history
   - Supports comments and actual hours tracking
   - Notifies Task Manager of changes

3. **get_task_info** - Retrieves detailed task information
   - Comprehensive task details
   - Optional comment/artifact inclusion
   - Subtask summaries
   - Time elapsed calculations

4. **list_project_tasks** - Lists tasks with filtering/sorting
   - Multiple filter options (status, priority, tags, assignment)
   - Overdue task detection
   - Flexible sorting
   - Subtask counts

### Priority 2: Scheduling Tools
Created 3 scheduling tools:

1. **schedule_wakeup** - Schedules wake-up calls
   - One-time and recurring schedules
   - Delayed mail delivery implementation
   - Flexible intervals (supports decimal hours)
   - End date and max occurrences for recurring

2. **list_scheduled_wakeups** - Lists scheduled wake-ups
   - Filter by target agent or creator
   - Show only active/recurring schedules
   - Time until delivery calculations
   - Past schedule inclusion option

3. **cancel_scheduled_wakeup** - Cancels scheduled wake-ups
   - Prevents future delivery
   - Cancellation reason tracking
   - Handles both one-time and recurring
   - Updates all related records

### Key Architecture Decisions
- Task Manager agents coordinate all task work
- Scheduling via delayed mail delivery (agent-first)
- File-based storage with future service integration points
- Full YAML metadata support with ai_prompt fields
- OpenAI-compatible parameter schemas

### Tool Discovery Status
Total tools discovered: 24
- Filesystem: 4 tools
- Project Management: 2 tools
- Knowledge Packs: 2 tools
- Task Management: 4 tools
- Scheduling: 3 tools
- Git: 3 tools (existing in core)
- Other: 6 tools (existing in core)

## Next Steps
1. Priority 2: Git Tools (git_status, git_commit, git_diff)
2. Priority 3: GitHub Tools (create_issue, create_pr, list_issues)
3. Priority 3: Analysis Tools (analyze_code, find_files)
4. Priority 4: Advanced AI Tools (remaining specialized tools)

## Technical Notes
- Fixed ComponentDiscovery path handling bug
- All tools follow consistent patterns
- Ready for agent integration testing
- Consider implementing actual mail queue service
