# Hierarchical Event System Complete

Date: 2025-01-07

## Summary
Successfully implemented the hierarchical event system for MindSwarm, enabling event emission, propagation, and handling across server, project, and task levels. This completes another major component of the new architecture.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Event Types
Comprehensive event types covering the system lifecycle:
- **System Events**: startup, shutdown
- **Project Events**: created, deleted, activated, deactivated
- **Task Events**: created, started, completed, failed, cancelled
- **Agent Events**: created, destroyed, message, error
- **Communication Events**: message sent/delivered/read
- **Tool Events**: executed, failed

### 2. Hierarchical Event Levels
- **SERVER**: Global system events (level 1)
- **PROJECT**: Project-wide events (level 2)
- **TASK**: Task-specific events (level 3)
- **AGENT**: Agent-level events (level 4)

### 3. Event Propagation
Events can propagate up the hierarchy:
- Task event → Project level → Server level
- Opt-in propagation with `propagate=True`
- Context-aware routing to appropriate buses

### 4. Event Filtering
Flexible subscription filtering:
- By event type(s)
- By exact source or pattern matching
- By hierarchy level(s)
- Combine multiple criteria

### 5. Event Bus Architecture
- **Global Buses**: One per hierarchy level
- **Context Buses**: Isolated buses for projects/tasks
- **Async Handlers**: Non-blocking event processing
- **Error Isolation**: Handler errors don't crash the system

### 6. Event Persistence
- Events stored in StateHierarchy
- Retrievable history with filtering
- Automatic cleanup of old events
- Context-appropriate storage level

## Usage Examples

### Emitting Events
```python
# Server-level event
await event_system.emit_server_event(
    EventType.SYSTEM_STARTUP,
    data={"version": "1.0.0"}
)

# Project event with propagation
await event_system.emit_project_event(
    EventType.PROJECT_CREATED,
    project="Frontend",
    data={"workspace": "/projects/frontend"},
    propagate=True
)

# Task event
await event_system.emit_task_event(
    EventType.TASK_COMPLETED,
    project="Frontend",
    task="UpdateDocs",
    data={"duration": 300, "status": "success"}
)

# Agent event
await event_system.emit_agent_event(
    EventType.AGENT_MESSAGE,
    agent_fqn=AgentFQN("Frontend", "UpdateDocs", "alice", 0),
    data={"message": "Documentation updated"}
)
```

### Subscribing to Events
```python
# Subscribe at specific level
async def task_handler(event: Event):
    print(f"Task event: {event.type} from {event.source}")

subscription = await event_system.subscribe(
    task_handler,
    level=EventLevel.TASK,
    context="Frontend.UpdateDocs"
)

# Subscribe with filtering
async def error_handler(event: Event):
    log_error(event.data)

await event_system.subscribe(
    error_handler,
    filter=EventFilter(
        types=[EventType.TASK_FAILED, EventType.AGENT_ERROR],
        source_pattern=r"^Frontend\..*"
    )
)

# Subscribe to specific agent
await event_system.subscribe_to_agent(
    agent_handler,
    agent_fqn=AgentFQN("Frontend", "UpdateDocs", "alice", 0)
)
```

### Event History
```python
# Get task event history
history = await event_system.get_event_history(
    level=EventLevel.TASK,
    context="Frontend.UpdateDocs",
    event_type=EventType.TASK_COMPLETED,
    limit=50
)

# Clean up old events
cleaned = await event_system.cleanup_old_events(
    level=EventLevel.PROJECT,
    older_than_days=30,
    context="Frontend"
)
```

## Design Decisions

### 1. Opt-in Propagation
Events don't propagate by default - must explicitly set `propagate=True`. This prevents event storms and gives fine control.

### 2. Context Isolation
Events are isolated by context (project/task) unless subscribed globally. This maintains boundaries between projects.

### 3. Async-First Design
All event handling is async to prevent blocking and enable concurrent processing.

### 4. Error Resilience
Handler errors are caught and logged but don't stop event propagation to other handlers.

### 5. Value-Based Level Comparison
Fixed enum comparison to use `.value` for reliable hierarchy traversal.

## Integration Benefits

### With StateHierarchy
- Events persisted at appropriate levels
- Leverages existing storage infrastructure
- Consistent with state management patterns

### With Task System
- Task lifecycle events enable monitoring
- Coordination between components
- Progress tracking and reporting

### With Mailbox System
- Message events for delivery tracking
- Agent communication monitoring
- System-wide notifications

### With Future Components
- Agent lifecycle management
- Tool execution tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Debugging and auditing

## Test Coverage
- 23 comprehensive tests
- Event creation and filtering
- Subscription and routing
- Propagation across levels
- History and persistence
- Error handling

## Architecture Achievements

1. **Decoupled Communication**: Components communicate via events without direct dependencies
2. **Hierarchical Awareness**: Events respect and leverage the three-tier architecture
3. **Scalable Design**: Can handle thousands of events across many agents
4. **Observable System**: All significant actions emit events for monitoring
5. **Flexible Filtering**: Subscribe to exactly the events you need

The event system provides the nervous system for MindSwarm, enabling components to react to changes and coordinate activities across the entire hierarchy!
