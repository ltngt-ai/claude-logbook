# Git Tools Implementation Complete

## Date: 2025-06-08

### Summary
Completed rapid implementation of core Git tools for MindSwarm as part of the feature/git-integration branch. All essential Git operations are now available as async-friendly tools following MindSwarm patterns.

### Implemented Tools

1. **git_add** - Stage files for commit
   - Supports specific files, patterns, and --all flag
   - Update mode for tracked files only
   - Force option for ignored files

2. **git_commit** - Create commits with agent authorship
   - Automatic agent signature in commit messages
   - Amend support for fixing previous commits
   - Author/date override capabilities

3. **git_branch** - Comprehensive branch management
   - Create, list, delete, rename operations
   - Special agent-namespaced branch support (agent/task-agentid-timestamp)
   - Remote branch tracking

4. **git_checkout** - Switch branches and restore files
   - Branch/tag/commit checkout
   - File-specific checkout for restoration
   - Agent branch creation shortcut
   - Force option with safety warnings

5. **git_merge** - Merge branches with conflict detection
   - Multiple merge strategies (recursive, ours, theirs)
   - No-fast-forward and squash options
   - Conflict detection and reporting
   - Merge abort capability

6. **git_diff** - View changes in repository
   - Working directory, staged, and commit comparisons
   - File-specific diffs
   - Statistics and name-only modes
   - Whitespace ignore option

7. **git_log** - View commit history
   - Flexible filtering (author, date, message)
   - Multiple output formats (detailed, oneline, graph)
   - File-specific history
   - Statistics per commit

8. **git_stash** - Temporary change storage
   - Save/pop/apply/drop operations
   - Include untracked files option
   - Keep index for partial stashing
   - List and show stash contents

### Design Patterns Used

All tools follow consistent MindSwarm patterns:
- Inherit from Tool base class
- Use ToolSchema for parameter validation
- Async execution with proper error handling
- Integration with GitRepository abstraction
- Context-aware (workspace directory, agent_id)
- Comprehensive result dictionaries

### Safety Features

- Agent-specific branches prevent conflicts
- Force operations require explicit flags
- Uncommitted changes warnings
- Conflict detection and reporting
- Proper error messages for guidance

### Next Steps

1. Create comprehensive test suite for all Git tools
2. Integrate with ProjectManager for automatic Git initialization
3. Add Git hooks for agent activity tracking
4. Implement GitHub plugin architecture
5. Create GitHub-specific tools (issues, PRs, etc.)

### Technical Notes

- All tools use the GitRepository abstraction layer for Git operations
- Async execution prevents blocking during long operations
- Consistent error handling with GitRepositoryError
- Agent context automatically included where relevant
- Results include both success/error status and detailed operation info

The implementation provides a solid foundation for version control integration in MindSwarm, enabling agents to safely work with Git repositories while maintaining proper isolation and tracking.
